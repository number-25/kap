So indeed he did.<br>The torrent roared, and we did buffet it<br>With lusty sinews, throwing it aside,<br>And stemming it with hearts of controversy.<br>But ere we could arrive the point proposed,<br>Caesar cried &ldquo;Help me, Cassius, or I sink?&rdquo;<br>Ay, as Aeneas our great ancestor<br>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder.<br>The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber<br>Did I the tired Caesar. And this man<br>Is now become a god, and Cassius is<br>A wretched creature, and must bend his body<br>If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.<br>He has a fever when he was in Spain,<br>And when the fit was on him, I did mark<br>How he did shake. &lsquo;Tis true, this god did shake.<br>His coward lips did from their color fly;<br>And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world<br>Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan,<br>Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans<br>Mark him and write his speeches in their books,<br>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; it cried, &ldquo;Give me some drink, Titinius,&rdquo;<br>As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me<br>A man of such a feeble temper should<br>So get the start of the majestic world,<br>And bear the palm alone!<br><em>Flourish and shout within</em>.\</p></div></div><div class="container has-text-centered"><aside><div id=share></div></aside><script type=text/javascript>$("#share").jsSocials({showLabel:!1,showCount:!1,shares:["email","twitter","facebook","googleplus","linkedin","pinterest","stumbleupon","whatsapp"]})</script></div><div class="container has-text-centered"></div><section class=section><div class="container has-text-centered"><p>; <a href="</p"></div></section>
