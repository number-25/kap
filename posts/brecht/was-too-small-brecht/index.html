Shui Ta and Shen Teh, I am both of them.<br>Your original order<br>To be good while yet surviving<br>Split me like lightning into two people. I<br>Cannot tell what occurred: goodness to others<br>And to myself could not both be achieved.<br>To serve both self and others I found too hard.<br>Oh, your world is arduous! Such need, such description!<br>The hand which is held out to the starving<br>Is quickly wrenched off! He who gives help to the lost<br>Is lost for his own part! For who could<br>Hold himself back from anger when the hungry are dying?<br>Where could I find so much that was needed, if not<br>In myself? But that was my downfall! The load of comandements<br>Forced me into the sludge. Yet if I broke the rules<br>I strode proudly around, and could eat myself full!<br>Something is wrong with this world of yours. Why<br>Is wickedness so rewarded, and why is so much suffering<br>Reserved for the good? Of, I felt such<br>Temptation to treat myself kindly! I felt too<br>A secret awareness inside me, for my foster-mother<br>Washed me with slops from the gutter! So I acquired<br>A sharp eye. A yet pity<br>Brought me such pain that I at once felt wolfish anger<br>At the sight of misery. Then<br>I could feel how I gradually altered and<br>My lips grew tight and hard. Bitter as ashes<br>The kind word felt in my mouth. And yet<br>I should gladly have been an Angel to the slums. For giving<br>Was still my delight. A smiling face<br>And I walked in the clouds.<br>Condemn me: each of my crimes<br>Was committed to help out my neighbour<br>To love my beloved or<br>To save my young song from going without.<br>O gods, for your vast projects<br>I, poor human, was too small.</p><p><img src=/images/wings-on-statue.jpg alt="Wings of Desire"></p></div></div><div class="container has-text-centered"><aside><div id=share></div></aside><script type=text/javascript>$("#share").jsSocials({showLabel:!1,showCount:!1,shares:["email","twitter","facebook","googleplus","linkedin","pinterest","stumbleupon","whatsapp"]})</script></div><div class="container has-text-centered"></div><section class=section><div class="container has-text-centered"><p>; <a href="</p"></div></section>
