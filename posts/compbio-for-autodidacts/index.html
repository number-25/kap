  <div class="content">
    <blockquote>
<p>Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people that prepare for it today &ndash; Malcolm X</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time I was labouring about with pipettes in hand, cutting and
pasting plasmids, asking questions about the edibility of my agarose gels. I
eventually parted ways with the wet lab and moved into teaching myself
Computational skills that I could apply to Biological questions. The journey
has been one of the most exciting, challenging but ultimately fulfilling. There
is a persistence that the auto-didactic approach requires; a humility and
continually curious energy. Given that Biology proper is increasingly pulling
from the Computational spheres in order to effectively pursue certain
questions, it is becoming increasingly important to be literate in these
spheres. Even a basic understanding of key concepts will take one quite far.</p>
<p>I have pulled from several individuals for inspiration and guidance – some of
them proficient by training, others, self taught. If not for their willingness
to share both their mistakes and their successes, I believe my path would have
been substantially more deviant than it has been already. It does not require
great effort to refer others to material which will help them. And so I want to
pay it forward, putting together a list of courses, books, essays, readings and
so on, which I have personally used (and hereby endorse), in understanding
Computational Biology, along with all the auxiliary disciplines which mesh into
the field (Probability, Statistics, Mathematics, Logic, Information Theory,
Computer Science etc.).</p>
<p>There is a parallel repository over at Github which contains the same
information as here.</p>
<h1 id="the-command-line">The Command Line</h1>
<h2 id="the-unix-workbench">The Unix Workbench</h2>
<p>The fundamental starting point in computational biology is the command line interface (CLI). It may terrify you
at first, but please persist, and move forward with excitement as you begin
traversing your system in a completely new way. Believe me, right now things
may seem so rosy and magical as you whiz around in your general user interface
(GUI), coddled by the ease of point and click, but with enough time, you will
begin dreading the clunkiness of some GUI programs. The majority of tools in
computational biology are built around a unix/linux system, and as such these
are generally the very basic requirements. Embarking on a journey of learning
unix based systems, in my opinion, comes with committing to a philosophy of
open software and freedom of access to information. This is fundamentally about
love. Love of education, love of knowledge, love of others, and a love of those
that come after us. It is not surprising that almost every resource I have come
across has offered a free version alongside paid options.</p>
<p>You will begin seeing how fundamental and necessary these programs are for the
proper functioning of modern day Scientific research. Hopefully you will
appreciate how beautifully efficient they are, and the elegance of simple bash
programs who aim to do one thing right.</p>
<p>You likely want to begin here, and take yourself so far, probably stopping
right before you reach the vim vs. emacs wars. After you’re proficient in
simple processes, then you can spend your precious time pondering whether
org-mode is worth trying.</p>
<h2 id="the-unix-workbench-by-sean-kross">The Unix Workbench by Sean Kross</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/seankross/the-unix-workbench">https://github.com/seankross/the-unix-workbench</a> Sean also kindly provides a
Coursera unit which follows the structure of the book – highly recommended
also.  Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous This is a companion resource
to Unix Workbench, it begins at the same skill level (beginner), and like Unix
Workbench, works through the essentials, with a focus on pragmatism. Having a
go at the exercises is worth while, and creating a personal cheat sheet of
sorts is also not a bad idea. Straight forward, stimulating and very helpful
for the beginner.</p>
<p>Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous by Michael Hartl.  Free online.  Data
Carpentry</p>
<p>Probably the most basic of all the introductory information resources for
getting into data analyses and bioinformatics. They are very short – often ~10
minute per page explanations of key concepts which may appear mundane and basic
to experienced users, but contain just the right amount of information to ease
beginners into the approach. I liked the short section on Cloud Genomics. If
you’d like to venture into other fields which utilise similar data analytic
approaches, such as Epidemiology or Ecology, then they also have some carpentry
courses in this too.</p>

Biostar Handbook One of the most empowering developments to come out of
bioinformatics/computational biology education is Biostars. I would put my
money on it that the word “Biostars” is familiar to every single student in
this field. The legendary forum for finding answers to what seems to be, every
practical question you could think of. Istvan Albert and his colleagues have
gone ahead and condensed their understanding into the Biostar Handbook, which,
at a very reasonable price (especially when it comes to textbooks) brings you
up to speed, and in my opinion, gets you very close to being competent and
independent. What I love most about this book is its brutal honesty, its
transparency and its emphasis on diligence and patience. They have slowly
started breaking the book up into more specific and parcelized mini-books that
focus on a particular topic. Another big benefit of this is that Istvan
generously provides full access to his University lectures, which are also
terrific.</p>
<p>Most recommended for beginners/entry level.  <a href="https://www.biostarhandbook.com">https://www.biostarhandbook.com</a>
Computational Biology: A Hypertextbook In searching for a beginner level
computational biology text that was up to date with more recent developments in
the field, I found it surprisingly difficult to track anything down that was
released less than 5 years ago. Either the text’s were focused on a specific
section of comp. bio., such as sequence matching algorithms, or they were
highly recommended relics released at the advent of high throughput sequencing
– classics indeed, but insufficient for a wholesome entry into the current
field. Scrolling through twitter I saw a recommendation for Scott Kelly’s and
Denis Didulo’s “Computational Biology: A Hypertextbook” – it seemed to tick all
the boxes. Despite the lack of reviews and anecdotes, I took the chance and
purchased the e-book. Given it’s main selling point is that it is a
Hypertext-book, I figured using the print form would be too clunky. So far I am
very happy with the purchase – it is generalised enough for a beginner, yet
still specific in ways that Biostars isn’t. For example it has chapters on
essentials such as how exactly the Smith-Waterman algorithm functions and so
on. An excellent reference text which deserves more attention! My biggest hunch
here is not with the textbook exactly, but rather with the ebook medium which
it uses – a service called VitalSource, a underpowered platform which allows
you to purchase books on how to use linux, only to then realise that their
standalone offline apps do not come with Linux compatibility!! How you would
open the book on Linux if you lacked internet connection is a mystery to me.
Either way – the book is great.</p>
<p>Recommended for beginners/entry level.
<a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Computational-Biology-Hypertextbook-Scott-Kelley/dp/1683670027">https://www.amazon.com.au/Computational-Biology-Hypertextbook-Scott-Kelley/dp/1683670027</a>
The Kelley lab.  Biological Sequence Analysis: Probabilistic Models of Proteins
and Nucleic Acids A classic in the field, Biological Sequence Analysis imports
quantitative methodology to answer interesting and challenging Biological
questions. An extremely relevant book which has aged extremely well. It was
published in 1998 – some serious mileage. The name speaks for itself; within
it, you will find writings on RNA structure co-variation analysis, sequence
alignment algorithms and so on. Pairing this text with the other works listed
here on Probability and Statistics, you may come to realise how clever and
useful the probabilistic framework is. Many of the approaches this book
discusses deserve the word essential, as they have build the field of Biology
as we know it today. I was recommended it by reading Sean Eddy’s blog, and
using programs he has been involved in such as Infernal and RScape. I will say
this – they dive right into it, and the recommended “map” for reading the book
is super cool. It stands as my go-to reference text on most things
computational-algorithmic, particularly when the detail matters and I’m not
searching for a quick and dirty method from internet forums. Everybody should
have a copy close by.</p>
<p>Paid, may be some free copies floating around though! It is very affordable
considering what you get for your money.  You won’t work through this book in a
few weeks, it’ll take patience and you’ll most often have to go away and think
on the material, test it out, see it in action, then come back for more.  Late
beginner all the way to advanced.  Courses Foundations of Computational and
Systems Biology I can’t be the only one who’s jaw hits the floor when they see
how rich MIT Open CourseWare has become, and how far back their content reaches
in time. There are perhaps no better examples of the spirit of education than
this initiative. Free lectures by some of the worlds top thinkers? You’ve gotta
be kidding me. MIT Open Courseware was made for auto-didacts, there is little
more you could ask for when seeking to educate yourself. Detailed course
structures and trajectories, additional recommended readings, good quality
videos, and no pay walls – yes!</p>
<p>This course is run by a couple of great educators (Christopher Burge, David
Gifford &amp; Ernest Fraenkel), who are also highly capable Scientists in their own
right. For one, Chris Burge is one of the pioneers of ab initio gene
prediction, a highly successful paradigm which allowed us to understand and
annotate much of the early high throughput sequencing data. He is also
centrally involved in the popular “Mixture of Isoforms” (MISO) package. I
recommend watching each lecture closely and definitely reading the accompanying
writings. This is quite the intensive program if you decide to apply yourself,
and it covers a sufficiently broad sweep of the field to give you the
confidence to move forwards.</p>

Applied Computational Genomics at the University of Utah (2020/2021) If you’ve
had to do play around with *.bam and *.bed files than you’ve very likely come
in contact with the excellent program called Bedtools. Almost every time I need
to use this program I discover something new about it, it just keeps on giving.
The brain behind the Bedtools is Aaron Quinlan, a leading Computational
Biologist out of the University of Utah . He offers a Semester long, completely
free course which lives on GitHub. Do you notice the trend here? World class
thinkers who are willing to spread their knowledge, help others, and move
Science forward, all without paywalls. Pay it forward if you ever get the
chance! This is a great, in depth course which has many practical tutorials
embedded within it. The homework is challenging and fulfilling – I have learned
a lot here. Did I mention that Aaron is a terrific, down to earth teacher?</p>

<p>Mathematics, Probability and Statistics Coming from Biology, a field closely
wedded to the qualitative aspects of Scientific inference, where our formal
training for the most part omits many of the approaches utilised by the ‘harder
sciences’, the transition to the quantitative world has perhaps been the most
challenging part of this. In some respects, you must undergo a great change in
how you approach problems, how you approach data and measures, and your
relationship to truth and validity. Much of this can be uncomfortable, as you
must confront the fragility of your prior approaches to questions. Personally,
this is an ongoing project which demands a lot of effort and grit. I have
immensely appreciated this change in my thought processes, and am very grateful
that it has taken place. The world is a bigger place now than it ever was. A
world where precision, consistency, and repetition are emphasised. You will
likely develop an obsession with priors, and with starting assumptions.
Sometimes before we can even approach a problem, we must sketch out some vague
axioms we believe to be important. Unfortunately, these topics are taught in
notoriously bland ways across campuses alike – they are premature, are forced,
and very often, the student barely has any confidence in their own logic and
reasoning. Such courses may at times skip over the very basic reason for using
tools such as probability theory in the first place; to make better decisions
in the presence of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Books Intuitive Biostatistics: A Nonmathematical Guide to Statistical Thinking
I believe this is the most comfortable introduction to conceptualising
problems, and answers, in a more quantitative manner. As the title outlines,
this book is almost purely built on intuitive explanations of key, widely used
procedures in statistics. It explains when you would do x, why you would do it,
why you wouldn’t, and more appropriately, the assumptions and biases associated
with it. If you’re afraid of equations (overcome this fear as soon as possible,
there is nothing to fear), you’ll be given that first bit of confidence that
should then give you the enthusiasm and energy to continue developing. The
language here is very clear, very direct, very concise and to the point. The
text is very honest, and works hard to provide bountiful examples of both good
and bad uses of statistics in the literature. You will enjoy working through
it, trust! The author Harvey Motulsky is the founder of GraphPad Statistical
Analysis software, so you may have already come across his creations without
knowing! There is also a smaller streamlined text from Harvey called “Essential
Biostatistics”, which is also worth reading if you just need a straight forward
and reduced explanation. One last note, this book leans heavily towards
biomedical research, and so most of the examples pull directly from this field.</p>
<p>PERFECT for absolute beginners. Great reference to have on hand for those more
familiar.  I must admit, the book is not cheap and the smaller “Essential” book
is just not worth buying – it is an anorexic ~150 pages of widely spaced
formatting. I used library copies for both until I had enough savings to
purchase the larger of the two books. If you prefer eBooks than I’d go looking.
Modern Statistics for Modern Biology Chances are that you’ve progressed enough
in your education that you’re now dealing with some very real datasets. And as
such, you likely have many outstanding questions directly related to the data
on your hands, the answers to which are scattered all across the internet, and
within various texts. This book will probably come down to you as a revelation.
It covers much of the same core content on statistical inference as volumes of
analogous books in this category do, but the biggest differences is it’s almost
singular focus on the application to biological datasets, very likely ones
similar to those that you have on your hands right now. It’s clear, filled with
witty and insightful comments, and even provides some of the history behind the
stats. You may choose to buy a physical of digital copy of the book, or use it
online, completely free – once again, given the quality of the book, it’s hard
to believe that you can access it free of charge; that’s love. Another really
impressive aspect of this is that it was completely written in R(markdown), and
the source code for compiling the book is open. As it was written in R, all of
the analyses are also undertaken in R, giving you that visceral feel for the
analysis. Bravo Susan and Wolfgang, you are leading the way. I purchased a
physical copy to support the authors, but I mainly use the online version as
frankly it’s easier to way.</p>
<p>Beginner to Intermediate with a keen interest.  Paid or free, you choose!
Probability Theory: The Logic of Science The more I have sunken into
Statistics, the more I have fallen in love with Probability Theory. This one is
a real heavyweight for you, one of those books you put on a shrine and hope
that may someday you’ll be able to comprehend it’s entirety. It marries
Bayesian and Frequentist approaches, and makes evident that probability theory
can be approached as an extension of Logic – as another tool of fundamental
reasoning, giving the ability to make decisions under uncertainty. This book,
despite it’s density, it’s mystery, reads beautifully. I only wish that Jaynes’
was still with us so that I could perhaps one day sit in on one of his
lectures. There is a honesty here which reminds me of Taleb, so you’ll find
yourself cracking up throughout. You’ll need to put your savings together for
this one! But if you’d like to get deep into Probability and have some loose
coin than this is a great option.</p>
<p>Intermediate to Advance level – have to be very keen to work through it.
You’ll need to touch up on your Math if you’re like me, go at your own pace.
Used in Elena Rivas Mathematics in Biology course (see below).  Here.
Mathematics for the Non-Mathematician A great book. Cannot recommend it enough.
There are many many positive reviews all over the web, I will just say, go and
get it. Morris Kline has a way of explaining cryptic things in simple ways and
for me personally, learning about the History of a concept helps me to
understand it a great deal. A joy to read.</p>
<p>Paid, but you should be able to find it from second hand book sellers such as
Thrift Books, Abe Books, World of Books etc.  No Bullshit Guide to Math &amp;
Physics/Linear Algebra.  Yes. No bullshit. Teach yourself linear algebra and
maths. Go ahead. Yes.</p>
<p>Courses Mathematics in Biology I greatly admire the work of Elena Rivas, I
think she is an excellent Scientist (under-appreciated too), so when I saw that
she was doing a semester long Mathematics for Biology course from Harvard, I
was over the moon! My excitement, soon transformed into humility, as the course
structure showed me just how far further I have to go in my own knowledge base.
It takes long enough to replace the brainwashing that Biologists go through in
our undergraduate days, being taught to freeze in horror at anything remotely
mathematical and quantitative. Courses such as this allow one to lay a new
foundation for Mathematics, and understand that so many Biological phenomena
can be better understood with the tools of Math. It is comprehensive and
rigorous, and is everything you expect the course to be. Another one of the
worlds leading thinkers, providing content to the world without reservations.</p>
<p>Completely free Head over to the course website.  Khan Academy Khan Academy is
pretty self explanatory – I think everybody under the age of 40 has watched one
of their videos at some point in their life. Their dedicated website gives you
a terrific and rather comprehensive introduction to Mathematics and Statistics
at most skill levels. I have no issues admitting that I used, and still use
Khan for self education. Plus, Khan is a great human being, so why not.</p>
