<p>What is that trechorous term, whos weight we cannot inherit, whos pressure
sustains and dissolves us at it&rsquo;s beckoning. Perhaps such is the feeling of one
embedded in the fabric of a time unknown to itself, yet so perfectly sure of
it&rsquo;s necessity. How does one speak of a self-reflective epoch, when modernity
wipes all previous memories into a thin glassy veneer? To reflect on our
emergence from the pond water of yesterday&rsquo;s imaginations, my poor poor
uncivilized sisters how hard the brick that cracked the back. In popular
opinion then, modernity is an elevation, an elation from inferiority to
prosperity. Life became easier, cleaner, more controlled, - yet our anxieties
find perhaps no relation in all of history, to speak to who in this lonely
wilderness, why, we are the self assured ones, no? Pride raises us up above
even Newton and his giants. It is difficult to ignore the propulsion which has
taken place, there is no doubt here. Tomorrow&rsquo;s leaps being ever greater, more
prosperous than yesterdays. Can we cope with prospects of decline? Is
modernities energy sapped, as if a simple designation that an event has passed
can circumscribe the cracks left by the ground shaking.  The recto to the verso
on the leaf of modernity, the tired, unimaginative, senile declaration of
defeat - what comes after tomorrow, well, the day-after-tomorrow. And so one
wonders whether this is the term slapped on by thinkers exhausted by one of the
central metrics of modernity - volume. Anywhere and everywhere. The struggle to birth the unborn - the morrow which lives in the current moments tensions.</p>
