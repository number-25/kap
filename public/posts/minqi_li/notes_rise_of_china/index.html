  <div class="content">
    <p>Notes on a terrific work in political economy. Extremely pertinent to our
present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose, in response to the current crisis of neoliberalism, global capitalism
is restructured with a greater degree of state intervention and more equal
distribution of income (is this not what much of the world&rsquo;s intellectual Left
is hoping for at the moment?), would it not be expected that in at most two or
three decades, there would be a new global profitability crisis? What should the
world&rsquo;s working classes (and the intellectual Left) do then? Wait for another
round of 30 years of neoliberalism to play itself out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Minqi succinctly captures the low-hanging demands of many political
commentators, who, having devoted ever more explanatory leverage to
neoliberalism, seem to have settled for modest targets in their political
philosophy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These movements of dynamic balances have led to successive &ldquo;systemic
cycles&rdquo;:the &ldquo;long fifteenth-sixteenth century&rdquo; (1350-1630) based on the
collaboration of the Genoese business communities and the Spanish state; the
&ldquo;long seventeenth century&rdquo; (1560-1790) based on Dutch hegemony; the &ldquo;long
nineteenth century&rdquo; (1740-1930) based on British hegemony; and the &ldquo;long
twentieth century&rdquo; (1870-?) based on American hegemony. In <em>The Long Twentieth
Century</em>, Giovanni Arrighi argued that the expansion and the growing complexity
of the capitalism world-economy had required the formation of &ldquo;political
structures endowed with ever-more extensive and complex organizational
capabilities to control the social and political environment of capital
accumulation on a worlds scale.&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the early nineteenth century, China was still the world&rsquo;s largest
territorial economy and China&rsquo;s GDP accounted for one-third of the gross world
product. Asia as a whole accounted for fully two-thirds of the gross world
product. From the early nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century, the
rise of the West was matched by the decline of Asia. By 1950, China&rsquo;s share in
the world GDP fell to less than 5 percent. In the early nineteenth century, the
gap in per capita GDP between China and the leading core states was about 2:1.
By 1950, the gap widened to about 20:1 and China was reduced to being among the
poorest populations in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following China&rsquo;s &lsquo;Century of Humiliation&rsquo; &ndash; thrashing through imperial exploits,
world war II, and it&rsquo;s own civil war, China was reduced to a state of widespread
poverty. It&rsquo;s recovery to the present day, is one of the greatest feats
of humankind - of all times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between 1960 and 1980, China&rsquo;s life expectancy at birth rose by 30.5 years.
This was an improvement greater than the world average, every country group, and
every selected country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;. China had followed the classic Soviet strategy of &ldquo;mercantilist
semi-withdrawal&rdquo; in the form of state ownership of the means of production and
centralized economic planning, in effect, complete state monopoly over the
domestic market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The former capitalists received compensation from the government and served as
managerial staff in the now state-owned enterprises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is clear that the Revolutionary China that existed in the period 1949-76
remained a part of the capitalist world-economy and was bound by the same basic
laws of motion (&ldquo;the law of value&rdquo;) of the capitalist world-economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite being based on a different socialisation model, market dynamics are unavoidable if
integration with the remaining world is sought. Firms and enterprises must still
compete in the same space, set prices, and exchange commodities with nations
from capitalist countries, whom overwhelmingly dominated trade. In this way, the
socialist states themselves are at the mercy of markets who&rsquo;s law of value is
likely in deep conflict with it&rsquo;s own conceptions of value. How to rise, develop
and embark on the paths of modernisation if one is constricted by the dominant
forms. If prices are set at certain levels, either one engages and enters into
relations, setting ones prices at competitive levels, levels predetermined by
powerful players, or one refuses and thus withdraws from the capitalist
world-economy. How could this make life possible? Socialist states preferring the
flavor of refusal are here islands, isolated from the potentially uplifting
benefits of such relations. Growth, development is on the agenda; people need
housing, clean water, education, health and enjoyment. No doubt, a world of
socialist states creates a vastly different environment, with laws of value who&rsquo;s
interaction requires explication and understanding - what could such a
socialisation look like?</p>
<p>Quoting Vicente Navarro: &ldquo;&hellip; contrary to prevalent belief, the level of health
of a population is not primarily the result of medical interventions&hellip; There is
no correlation between level of medical expenditures and level of health&hellip; the
health of the population is the outcome of a whole set of social, economic, and
political interventions, among which medical care plays a minor role&hellip; Thus
health indicators are good indicators of social and economic development.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This brings to memory the foundation text on inequality and health indicates, &ldquo;The Spirit Level by Richard Wilkinson
and Kate Pickett&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, the historical tendency indicated that a growing proportion of the
bureaucratic and technocratic elites tended to become, and some former
revolutionaries tended to degenerate into, selfish careerists who were only
interested in the expansion of individual wealth and power. Once these selfish
careerists had become the majority in the elites and managed to consolidate
their material privileges and power, then a new exploiter class in the form of
privileged bureaucrats, privileged technocrats, and bureaucratic capitalists,
alienated from the worker and peasants, would have emerged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most Chinese intellectuals in the 1980s were from families that had been
capitalists or landlords before the Revolution. Their resentments against the
Revolution (especially the Cultural Revolution) were strong and they often did
not hide their contempt and hatred of ordinary workers and peasants&hellip; All of
these wer behind the intellectuals&rsquo; call for &ldquo;freedom and democracy.&rdquo; In effect,
the Chinese urban middle class was demanding a bigger share of the power as
China moved towards capitalism. Some intellectuals explicitly called for
&ldquo;neo-authoritarianism&rdquo;, citing Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea as
models, that is, they advocated a capitalist model that would be repressive
towards the working class but could secure &ldquo;property rights&rdquo; for capitalists and
&ldquo;civil liberty&rdquo; for intellectuals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After 1992, the Chinese ruling elites were ready to undertake mass
privatization. Tens of millions of state-sector workers were laid off. Those
that retained employment were deprived of their traditional socialist rights,
such as job security, medical insurance, access to housing, and guaranteed
pensions. In the meantime, privatization in the rural areas has destroyed the
rural public health care and education systems, which had been very effective
during the Maoist era in meeting the rural population&rsquo;s basic needs. Hundreds of
millions of peasants migrated to the cities, finding work under sweatshop
conditions. The defeat of the urban working class and the creation of a massive
surplus labor force laid down the foundation of China&rsquo;s capitalist boom. By the
early 2000s, China had become the world&rsquo;s &ldquo;workshop,&rdquo; the center of the world&rsquo;s
export manufacture. China&rsquo;s economic rise has important global implications.
First, China&rsquo;s deeper incorporation into the capitalist world-economy has
massively increased the size of the global reserve army of cheap labor force. In
some industries, this allows capitalists in the core states to directly lower
their wages and other costs by relocating capital to China. But more important
is the &ldquo;threat effect.&rdquo; That is, capitalists in the core states force core-state
workers to accept lower wages and worse working conditions by threatening to
move their factories of office to cheap labor areas such as China, without
actual movement of physical capital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alan Greenspan&rsquo;s &ldquo;traumatized worker&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After years of rapid world economic growth, global excess production capacity
is being depleted, while there has been growing upwards pressure on energy and
commodities prices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The US&rsquo;s general government balance moved swiftly from a surplus of 1.4 percent of GFP
to a deficit of 4.6 percent of GFP between 2000 [Clinton term] and 2003 [Bush
term], or an expansionary swing of 6 percent of GDP. The Federal Reserve cut the
short-term interest rate by 5.5 percentage points and kept real interest rates
below or near zero for years. The resultant massive increase in money supply
helped to stabilize the stock market but it soon led to a much bigger housing
bubble, which in turn led to a new round of debt-financed consumption boom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In terms of near zero interest rates, this is a chillingly similar scenario to
that which has transpired in Australia during the recent debt-heavy housing
boom. Australia&rsquo;s household debt-to-gdp ratio is at a shocking figure of ~130%.
A short history of Doom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With stagnant real incomes and wages, the expansion of the US private
consumption has been financed largely by household borrowings [credit]&hellip;. US
household debt has soared from about 60 percent of GFP in the early 1990s to
about 100 percent of GFP today, and under the current trend could rise to 120
percent of GDP by 2010.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In recent years, health care, education, and housing costs have surged, known
to the Chinese working people as the &ldquo;new three mountains,&rdquo; (the old &ldquo;three
mountains&rdquo; referred to the pre-Revolution forces of oppression: imperialism,
feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism)&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;China&rsquo;s huge reserve army of cheap labor has been a major factor in undermining
the bargaining power of the global working classes. However, capitalist
development has been transforming China&rsquo;s own social structure and a large
proletarianized working class is emerging in China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All social systems that are based on the exploitation of the great majority are
confronted with the question: how can the unified rebellion of the exploited
majority be prevented? Without an effective solution to this problem, it is
unlikely that any exploitative system can survive for long. Historically, the
problem has been &ldquo;resolved&rdquo; by dividing the majority into &ldquo;a larger lower stratum
and a smaller middle stratum.&rdquo; The middle stratum is both exploiter and
exploited. By providing the middle stratum with access to a portion of the
surplus product, the ruling elites buy off the potential political leadership of
the exploited majority&hellip; within each state, the working population is to be
divided between a great majority and a relatively privileged &ldquo;middle class&rdquo; or
&ldquo;labor aristocracy&rdquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The 1980s and 1990s were &ldquo;lost decades&rdquo; for the historical well-to-do
semi-peripheral states. From 1980 to 2000, Latin America saw its income index
(as a ratio of the world average per capita GDP) fall from 129 to 95, and Middle
East and North Africa saw its income index fall from 75 to 64. The eastern
European index collapsed from 129 in 1989 to 82 in 2000.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking Argentina as an example, the repeated &lsquo;free market openings&rsquo; and
&lsquo;privatization efforts&rsquo; failed to hoist the nation from its debt peonage,
rather, worsening the situation over the course of decades. Each failed round of
austerity and debt restructuring was followed by another round of crisis, who&rsquo;s
remedy was the prescription of yet another round of the same medication &ndash; a
cynical and demented situation for millions of workers. One had to begin
wondering whom this US-IMF approach was actually aiding?</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to one report, about two million high and middle-ranking, current and
retired Chinese government officials and their relatives own about 70 percent of
the total private wealth (savings, stocks, bonds, houses and foreign
exchanges) in China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An approximation which urgently needs to be followed up on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the capitalist world-economy, the problem of China lies with its huge size.
China has a labor force that is larger than the total labor force in all of the
core states, or that in the entire historical well-to-do semi-periphery. As
China competes with the well-to-do semi-peripheral states in a wide range of
global commodity chains, the competition eventually would lead to the
convergence between China and the historical well-to-do semi-peripheral states
in profit rates and wage rates. The convergence may take place in an upward or a
downward manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A continent size state of bloc of states is probably the largest possible
political unit that can be accommodated in the capitalist world-economy without
undermining the necessary condition of inter-state competition. It seems that
the capitalist world-economy, through successive expansions, has reached one of
its historical limits. Its volume and density have by now grown to the point
that it cannot be effectively regulated by any political unit that is smaller
than a continent sized state and as its volume and density keep growing, the
effective regulation of the system would probably require some unit that is
significantly larger than a continent-size unit. On the other hand, any
political unit that is significantly larger than continent sized state could be
politically overwhelming in that it would in effect end inter-state competition
and remove a necessary condition for an economic system based on the endless
accumulation of capital. To the extend this dilemma cannot be resolved within
the historical framework of the existing world-system, we are approaching the
moment of demise of the capitalist world-economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In finance, the interest rate represents the growth rate of debt. Thus, if the
real interest rate is higher than the economic growth rate, then the debt:income
ratio trends to rise indefinitely, imposing ever greater burden on the debtors.
This tendency, if not checked, would lead to widespread bankruptcies of
households, business, and governments, ending with a general economic collapse.
Indeed, the surge in the US&rsquo;s real interest rate immediately led to the debt
crisis throughout Latin America, Africa, and eastern Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Contrary to the notion that these countries entered crises under the so called
&lsquo;weight of their own contradictions and endless political repressions&rsquo;.. a
mysterious and unserious line of thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This understanding of systemic processes is consistent with the historical
materialist argument that all social systems are historical. It follows that
capitalism is a historically specific social system that is appropriate only
under certain historical conditions and must give way to a new social system as
the underlying historical conditions change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; for China and India to have any chance to rise to the status of a
hegemonic power, they will have to exploit the rest of the world&rsquo;s resources on
a massive scale. This will immediately bring them into conflict with North
America and Western Europe that have so far benefited from consuming resources
at levels much higher than not only the world average but also their own
bio-capacities. But the world as a whole has already overshot its ecological
limit, and it can hardly survive the &ldquo;rise of China&rdquo; or the &ldquo;rise of India&rdquo; in
such a manner.&rdquo;</p>
