  <div class="content">
    <p>A few beautiful lines from <em>Julius Caesar</em></p>
<p><em>Cassius; lean and hungry&hellip;</em></p>
<p><strong>CASSIUS</strong><br>
I know that virtue to be in your, Brutus,<br>
As well as I do know your outward favor.<br>
Well, honor is the subject of my story.<br>
I cannot tell what you and other men<br>
Think of this life; but for my single self,<br>
I had as lief not be, as live to be<br>
In awe of such a thing as I myself.<br>
I was born free as Caesar, so were you.<br>
We both have fed as well, and we can both<br>
Endure the winter&rsquo;s cold as well as he.<br>
For once upon a raw and gusty day,<br>
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shoes,<br>
Said Caesar to me &ldquo;Dar&rsquo;st thou, Cassius, now<br>
Leap in with me into this angry flood,<br>
And swim to yonder point?&rdquo; Upon the word,<br>
Accoutred as I was I plunged in,<br>
And bade him follow. So indeed he did.<br>
The torrent roared, and we did buffet it<br>
With lusty sinews, throwing it aside,<br>
And stemming it with hearts of controversy.<br>
But ere we could arrive the point proposed,<br>
Caesar cried &ldquo;Help me, Cassius, or I sink!&rdquo;<br>
Ay, as Aeneas our great ancestor<br>
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder.<br>
The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber<br>
Did I the tired Caesar. And this man<br>
Is now become a god, and Cassius is<br>
A wretched creature, and must bend his body<br>
If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.<br>
He has a fever when he was in Spain,<br>
And when the fit was on him, I did mark<br>
How he did shake. &lsquo;Tis true, this god did shake.<br>
His coward lips did from their color fly;<br>
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world<br>
Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan,<br>
Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans<br>
Mark him and write his speeches in their books,<br>
&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; it cried, &ldquo;Give me some drink, Titinius,&rdquo;<br>
As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me<br>
A man of such a feeble temper should<br>
So get the start of the majestic world,<br>
And bear the palm alone!<br>
<em>Flourish and shout within</em>.</p>
<p><strong>CASSIUS</strong>
Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world<br>
Like a Colossus, and we petty men<br>
Walk under his huge legs, and peep about<br>
To find ourselves dishonorable graves.<br>
Men at sometime were masters of their fates.<br>
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars.<br>
But in ourselves, that we are underlings.<br>
Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that &ldquo;Caesar&rdquo;?<br>
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?<br>
Write them together: yours is a fair name.<br>
Sound them: it doth become the mouth as well.<br>
Weigh them: it is as heavy. Conjure with &rsquo;em:<br>
&ldquo;Brutus&rdquo; will start a spirit as soon as &ldquo;Caesar.&rdquo;<br>
Now in the names of all the gods at once,<br>
Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed<br>
That he is grown so great? Age, though art shamed.<br>
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods.<br>
When went there by an age since the great flood,<br>
But it was famed with more than with one man?<br>
When could they say till now, that talked of Rome,<br>
That her wide walls encompassed but one man?<br>
Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough<br>
When there is in it but one only man.<br>
O, you and I have heard our fathers say<br>
There was a Brutus once that would have brooked<br>
Th&rsquo; eternal devil to keep his state in Rome<br>
As easily as a king.\</p>
<p><strong>BRUTUS</strong>
But &rsquo;tis a common proof<br>
That lowliness is young ambitions ladder,<br>
Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;<br>
But when he once attains the upmost round,<br>
He then unto the ladder turns his back,<br>
Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees<br>
By which he did ascend&hellip;\</p>
<p><strong>CALPURNIA</strong>
When beggars die there are no comets seen;<br>
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.\</p>
<p><strong>CAESAR</strong>
The gods do this in shame of cowardice.<br>
Caesar should be a beast without a heart<br>
If he should stay home today for fear.<br>
No, Caesar shall not. Danger knows full well<br>
That Caesar is more dangerous than he.<br>
We are two lions littered in one day,<br>
And I the elder and more terrible.<br>
And Caesar shall go forth.\</p>
<p><strong>ARTEMDORUS</strong>
My heart laments that virtue cannot live<br>
Out of the teeth of emulation.</p>
<p><strong>ANTONY</strong>
O pardon me, though bleeding piece of earth,<br>
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers.<br>
Though art the ruins of the noblest man<br>
That ever lived in the tide of times.<br>
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!<br>
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy &mdash;<br>
Which like dumb mouth do ope their ruby lips<br>
To bed the voice and utterance of my tongue &mdash;<br>
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;<br>
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife<br>
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;<br>
Blood and destruction shall be so in use,<br>
And dreadful objects so familiar,<br>
That mothers shall but smile when they behold<br>
Their infants quartered with the hands of war,<br>
All pity chocked with custom of fell deeds;<br>
And Caesar&rsquo;s spirit, ranging for revenge,<br>
With Ate by his side come hot from hell,<br>
Shall in these confines with a monarch&rsquo;s voice<br>
Cry &ldquo;havoc!&rdquo; and let slip the dogs of war,<br>
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth<br>
With carrion men, groaning for burial.<br>
<br>
<br>
O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts,<br>
And men have lost their reason!\</p>
<p><strong>MESSALA</strong>
O hateful Error, Melancholy&rsquo;s child</p>
