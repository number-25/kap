      <description>Some quotes, notes and scribblings on a now famous book on the age of infant Capitalism in England &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;The World Turned Upside Down&amp;rdquo; by Christopher Hill.

These folks were far from misunderstanding brutes, mean multitudes. They were people fighting for a better life, and they knew in their bones they deserved it.</description>
