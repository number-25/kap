      <description>Some quotes, notes and scribblings on a now famous book on the age of infant Capitalism in England &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;The World Turned Upside Down&amp;rdquo; by Christopher Hill. It is remarkable how contemporary these seedlings of revolution feel, the ethics, shared understandings of power, and the materialism of so much of the so called sacred world of authority. These folks were far from misunderstanding brutes, mean multitudes. They were people fighting for a better life, and they knew in their bones they deserved it.</description>

      <description>Notes on a terrific work in political economy. Extremely pertinent to our present.
&amp;ldquo;Suppose, in response to the current crisis of neoliberalism, global capitalism is restructured with a greater degree of state intervention and more equal distribution of income (is this not what much of the world&amp;rsquo;s intellectual Left is hoping for at the moment?), would it not be expected that in at most two or three decades, there would be a new global profitability crisis?</description>

      <description>It is possible that at times people drape themselves in Roman tunics to play the bourgeois revolution&amp;mdash;or that a general wnats to play Joan of Arc in twentieth-century dress; but how is it that, in real history, it is never Zerlina who replies to Agamemnon and that Brutus never has Monsieur Perrichon for his friend and confidant? - Cornelius Castoriadis</description>

      <description>By Mikhail Sholokhov,
How human beings have sullied, have poisoned the world! How much human misery has been poured out! She turned passionately towards Bunchuk and sought for his hand. &amp;lsquo;Tell me, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be sweet to die for that? Tell me! Yes? What is there to believe in, if not in that? What is one to live for? It seems to me that if I die in the struggle&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo; She pressed his hand to her chest so that he felt the muffled beating of her heart, and gazing up at him with a deep, darkened glance, she whispered: &amp;lsquo;&amp;hellip; and if death is not instantaneous, then the last thing I shall feel will be that triumphant, disturbingly beautiful music of the future.</description>

      <description>This is not meant as a reproach. The past is not irreproachable, but there is no sense in reproaching it. It should be studied. &amp;ndash; Maxim Gorky</description>

      <title>Some Reflections on &#39;The Gift&#39; by Marcel Mauss</title>

      <description>A few excerpts from the tremendous text.
&amp;ldquo;These peoples [Melanesian tribes] possess an extra domestic economy and a very developed system of exchange that throbs with life more intensely and more precipitantly perhaps than the one that our peasants or the fishing villages along our coasts were familiar with maybe not even a hundred years ago. They have an extensive economic life, going beyond the confines of the islands and their dialects, which represents a considerable trade.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Malcolm X
Once upon a time I was labouring about with pipettes in hand, cutting and pasting plasmids, asking questions about the edibility of my agarose gels. I eventually parted ways with the wet lab and moved into teaching myself Computational skills that I could apply to Biological questions. The journey has been one of the most exciting, challenging but ultimately fulfilling.</description>

      <title>The Eternal Now by Paul Tillich</title>

      <description>What follows are some of my favorite excerpts from the Theologian Paul Tillich&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;lsquo;The Eternal Now&amp;rsquo;.
They withdraw into a self-chosen loneliness, taking revenge through bitterness and hostility towards those they feel have rejected them, actually enjoying the pain of their loneliness.
One of these ways is the desire towards the silence of nature. We can speak without voice to the trees and the clouds and the waves of the sea.</description>

      <title>Was Too Small by Bertolt Brecht</title>

      <description>Shen Teh:
Yes, it is me. Shui Ta and Shen Teh, I am both of them.
Your original order
To be good while yet surviving
Split me like lightning into two people. I
Cannot tell what occurred: goodness to others
And to myself could not both be achieved.
To serve both self and others I found too hard.
Oh, your world is arduous! Such need, such description!
The hand which is held out to the starving</description>

      <guid>https://kobeandpascal.com/posts/brecht/the-good-and-the-gods/</guid>
      <description>From the Interlude of &amp;ldquo;The Good Person of Szechwan&amp;rdquo; by Bertolt Brecht - John Willet Translation.
Song of the Defencelessness of the Good and the Gods
Shen Teh:
In our country
The capable man needs luck. Only
If he has mighty backers
Can he prove his capacity.
The good
Have no means of helping themselves and the gods are
powerless.
So why can&amp;rsquo;t the gods launch a great operation
With bombers and battleships, tanks and destroyers</description>

      <description>From Scene Four of &amp;ldquo;The Good Person of Szechwan&amp;rdquo; by Bertolt Brecht - John Willet Translation.
Shen Teh, to the audience : I had never seen the city at dawn. These were the hours when I used to lie with my filthy blanket over my head, terrified to wake up. Today I mixed with the newsboys, with the men who were washing down the streets, with the ox-carts bringing fresh vegetables in from the fields.</description>

      <description>From Scene Three of &amp;ldquo;The Good Person of Szechwan&amp;rdquo; by Bertolt Brecht - John Willet Translation.
It starts raining.
Shen Teh: What&amp;rsquo;s that rope for? You&amp;rsquo;re not to do it!
Sun: Mind you&amp;rsquo;re own business! And get out of the way!
Shen Teh: It&amp;rsquo;s raining.
Sun: Don&amp;rsquo;t you try sheltering under my tree.
Shen Teh remains motionless in the rain : No.
Sun: Why not give up, sister, it&amp;rsquo;s no use.</description>

      <description>From Scene One of &amp;ldquo;The Good Person of Szechwan&amp;rdquo; - John Willet translation
The Grandfather:
Once I believed intelligence would aid me I was an optimist when I was younger
Now that I&amp;rsquo;m old I see it hasn&amp;rsquo;t paid me: How can intelligence compete with hunger?
And so I said: drop it!
Like smoke twisting grey
Into ever colder coldness you&amp;rsquo;ll Blow away.
The man:
I saw the conscientious man get nowhere</description>

      <description>Beside the Yellow River, on the bank of the waters of the Yan,
is the yellow earth plateau. Before the yaodong caves the millstone grinds,
it seems a return to yesterday.
I’m going to Yan’an,
to see the soft passing of time,
to see thousands of hills, everywhere red.</description>

      <description>Who built the seven gates of Thebes?
The books are filled with names of kings.
Was it the kings who hauled the craggy blocks of stone?
And Babylon, so many times destroyed.
Who built the city up each time? In which of Lima&amp;rsquo;s houses,
That city glittering with gold, lived those who built it?
In the evening when the Chinese wall was finished
Where did the masons go? Imperial Rome</description>

      <description>Modernities Morrow What is that trechorous term, whos weight we cannot inherit, whos pressure sustains and dissolves us at it&amp;rsquo;s beckoning. Perhaps such is the feeling of one embedded in the fabric of a time unknown to itself, yet so perfectly sure of it&amp;rsquo;s necessity. How does one speak of a self-reflective epoch, when modernity wipes all previous memories into a thin glassy veneer? To reflect on our emergence from the pond water of yesterday&amp;rsquo;s imaginations, my poor poor uncivilized sisters how hard the brick that cracked the back.</description>
