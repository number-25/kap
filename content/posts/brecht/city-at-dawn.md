From Scene Four of "The Good Person of Szechwan" by Bertolt Brecht - John Willet Translation.  

**Shen Teh**, *to the audience* **:** I had never seen the city at dawn. These
were the hours when I used to lie with my filthy blanket over my head,
terrified to wake up. Today I mixed with the newsboys, with the men who were
washing down the streets, with the ox-carts bringing fresh vegetables in from
the fields. It was a long walk from Sun's neighbourhood to here, but with ever
step I grew happier. I had always been told that when one is in love one walks
on air, but the wonderful thing is that one walks on earth, on tarmac. I tell
you, at dawn the blocks of buildings are like rubbish heaps with little lights
glowing in them; the sky is pink but still transparent, clear of dust. I tell
you, you miss a great deal if you are not in love and cannot see your city at
that hour when she rises from her couch like a sober old crafstman, filling his
lungs with fresh air and reaching for his tools, as the poets have it. *To the
group waiting*: Good morning! Here is your rice! *She shares it out, then
notices Wang*: Good morning, Wang. I am light-headed today. All the way I
looked at my reflection in the shop windows, and now I would like to buy myself
a shawl. *After a short hesitation*: I should so like to look beautiful.
