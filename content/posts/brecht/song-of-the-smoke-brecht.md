From Scene One of "The Good Person of Szechwan" - John Willet translation   

**The Grandfather:**   
Once I believed intelligence would aid me
I was an optimist when I was younger  
Now that I'm old I see it hasn't paid me: 
How can intelligence compete with hunger?  
  And so I said: drop it!  
  Like smoke twisting grey  
  Into ever colder coldness you'll
  Blow away.  
**The man:**  
	I saw the conscientious man get nowhere  
	And so I tired the crooked path instead  
	But crookedness makes our sort travel slower.  
	There seems to be no way to get ahead.  
		Likewise I say: drop it!   
		Like smoke twisting grey  
		Into ever colder coldness you'll  
		Blow away.  
**The niece:**  
	+ The old, they say, find little fun in hoping.  
	+ Time's what they need, and time begins to press.  
	+ But for the young, they say, the gates are open.  
	+ They open, so they say, on nothingness.  
		+ And I too say: drop it!  
		+ Like smoke twisting grey  
		+ Into ever colder coldness you'll  
		+ Blow away.
