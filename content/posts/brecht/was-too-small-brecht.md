**Shen Teh:**   
Yes, it is me. Shui Ta and Shen Teh, I am both of them.   
Your original order  
To be good while yet surviving  
Split me like lightning into two people. I   
Cannot tell what occurred: goodness to others  
And to myself could not both be achieved.  
To serve both self and others I found too hard.  
Oh, your world is arduous! Such need, such description!  
The hand which is held out to the starving  
Is quickly wrenched off! He who gives help to the lost  
Is lost for his own part! For who could  
Hold himself back from anger when the hungry are dying?  
Where could I find so much that was needed, if not  
In myself? But that was my downfall! The load of comandements  
Forced me into the sludge. Yet if I broke the rules  
I strode proudly around, and could eat myself full!  
Something is wrong with this world of yours. Why  
Is wickedness so rewarded, and why is so much suffering  
Reserved for the good? Of, I felt such  
Temptation to treat myself kindly! I felt too  
A secret awareness inside me, for my foster-mother  
Washed me with slops from the gutter! So I acquired  
A sharp eye. A yet pity  
Brought me such pain that I at once felt wolfish anger  
At the sight of misery. Then  
I could feel how I gradually altered and  
My lips grew tight and hard. Bitter as ashes  
The kind word felt in my mouth. And yet  
I should gladly have been an Angel to the slums. For giving  
Was still my delight. A smiling face  
And I walked in the clouds.  
Condemn me: each of my crimes  
Was committed to help out my neighbour  
To love my beloved or  
To save my young song from going without.  
O gods, for your vast projects  
I, poor human, was too small.
