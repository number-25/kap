From the Interlude of "The Good Person of Szechwan" by Bertolt Brecht - John Willet Translation.  

**Song of the Defencelessness of the Good and the Gods**  

**Shen Teh:**  
In our country  
The capable man needs luck. Only  
If he has mighty backers  
Can he prove his capacity.  
The good  
Have no means of helping themselves and the gods are  
powerless.  
So why can't the gods launch a great operation  
With bombers and battleships, tanks and destroyers  
And rescue the good by a ruthless invasion?  
Then mabe the wicked would cease to annoy use.  
\  
*She puts on Shui Ta's costume and takes a few steps in his way of walking*  
\  
The good  
Cannot remain good for long in our country  
Where cupboards are bare, housewives start to squabble.  
Oh, the divine commandments  
Are not much use against hunger.  
So why can't the gods share out what they've created  
Come down and distribute the bounties of nature  
And allow us, once hunger and thirst have been sated  
To mix with each other in friendship and pleasure?  
\  
*She dons Shui Ta's mask and sings on in his voice.*  
\   
In order to win one's mid-day meal  
One needs the toughness which elsewhere builds empires.  
Except twelve others be trampled down  
The unfortunate cannot be helped.  
So why can't the gods make a simple decision  
That goodness must conquer in spite of its weakness? --  
Then back up the good with an armoured division  
Command it to: 'fire!' and not tolerate meekness?
