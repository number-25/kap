Some quotes, notes and scribblings on a now famous book on the age of infant
Capitalism in England -- "The World Turned Upside Down" by Christopher Hill. It
is remarkable how contemporary these seedlings of revolution feel, the
ethics, shared understandings of power, and the materialism of so much of the so
called sacred world of authority. These folks were far from misunderstanding
brutes, mean multitudes. They were people fighting for a better life, and they
knew in their bones they deserved it.           

"Now that the protestant ethic itself, the greatest achievement of European
bourgeois society in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, is at last being
questioned after a rule of three or four centuries, we can study with a new
sympathy the Digger, the Rangers, and the many other darking thinkers who in
the seventeenth century refused to bow down and worship it."   

Capitalism was indeed a shattering of both traditional social norms and forms
-- what is often hidden, is the tremendous and varying resistance to the
branching infiltration of this new social logic into the lives of everyday
people. This transition was not so easily 'smoothed over' and accepted as
given, that, instead is a contemporaneous feeling.   

"The New Model, the creation of which had been so fiercely opposed by
conservatives, seemed to have saved the social order: this no doubt was the
calculation of many M.P.s who voted for it. But the New Model, as it was to
declare proudly in June 1647, was 'no mere mercenary Army'; it was the common
people in uniform, closer to their views than to those of the gentry or
Parliament. And the free discussion which was permitted in this unique army led
to a fantastically rapid development of political thinking."    

"Familism, developing the lower-class scepticism of the Lollards, was an
anti-clerical, layman's creed."

"Further evidence of the unpopularity of the whole church establishment is to
be found in the popular iconoclasm which broke out whenever opportunity
offered: in the late 1630s and 40s altar rails were pulled down, altars
desecrated, statues on tombs destroyed, ecclesiastical documents burnt, pigs
and horses baptized."

"Many such poor pretences, merely to drain the people's purses, did their
officers make. It was thus nothing new when in 1642 the Rev. Edmund Calamy told
the House of Commons that 'the people complain of their ministers, that they
are dumb dogs, greedy dogs, which can never have enough'. They also complained
that university-educated divines tended to be members of the ruling class."    

"They encouraged the expectations that Christ's kingdom was at hand ---
expectations which John Milton among many others shared. What turned out to be
especially dangerous was the wholly traditional view, repeated by many of the
preachers, that the common people had a very special role to play in this
crisis, that they were somehow more chosen than the rich and the powerful. 'The
voice that will come of Christ's reigning is like to begin from those that are
the multitude, that are so contemptible especially in the eyes of Antichrist's
spirits and the prelacy.' The words are those of a perfectly respectable
Independent divine, by no means an extreme radical, who believed the last time
would begin in 1950. There were many similar sermons preached: the doctrine
became almost orthodox on the Parliamentary side. A little imagination will
convey to us the effect of this prospect in conditions of economic and
political crisis, when Parliament itself was calling the common people to
political action for the first time in history, when the accredited preachers
of God's word not only proclaimed that the millennium was approaching but told
'you that are of the meaner rank, common people' that they were to take the
lead in forwarding Christ's cause."   

This passage among many, throws much light on the current situation (Al Aqsa
flood) in Palestine, Gaza. Norman Finkelstein has made a similar point,
contrasting the religious fervor of the Nat Turner led abolisionists, who,
possessed by a spiritual force, demanded their freedom at any cost.    

"There was then a long tradition of popular materialist scepticism and
anti-clericalism;there was the Familist tradition that Christ was within every
believer; there was the sectarian tradition of opposition to a state church, to
the tithes which paid for its ministers and to the patronage system which
ensured that its clergy were appointed by the ruling class. There were also the
millenarian hopes built up by the Puritan preachers. It is hardly surprising
that the breakdown of censorship and the establishment of effective religious
toleration let loose a flood of speculation that hitherto had only been
muttered in secret. In England as in Switzerland 'the lower sort of people
being bred in an ancient hatred against the superiors', greedily embraced the
doctrines of Anabaptism."   

A long tradition... 

"The sects insisted that minsters should be elected by the congregation and
paid by the voluntary contributions of its members; many of them denied the
need for separated clergy at all, and would have had a gifted layman preach on
Sunday whilst labouring with his hands the other six days of the week. They
advocated toleration for all protestant sects, rejecting ecclesiastical
censorship and all forms of ecclesiastical jurisdiction in favour of a
congregational discipline with no coercive sanction behind it. They attached
little important to many of the traditional sacraments of the church. Their
programme would have destroyed the national church, leaving each congregation
responsible for its own affairs with only the loosest contact between
congregations; the church would no longer have been able to mould opinion in a
single pattern, to punish 'sin' or proscribe 'heresy'. There would have been no
control over the thinking of the middle and lower classes."   

"The New Model was the match which fired the gunpowder.
But once the conflagration started, there was plenty of combustible material lying around. To appreciate this we must
look at the development of radical and heretical ideas in England, some religious, others secular; some inherited from the
Lollards, some imported from the continent, all modified in
the rapidly changing society of sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century England. Chapter 2 attempted to survey some of these
traditions; chapters 6, 7 and 8 pick out others. In the hectic
and exhilarating freedom of the 1640s and 50s all these elements
were cast into a melting pot from which unprecedented new
compounds were to emerge."

"The Reformation, for all its hostility to magic, had stimulated
the spirit of prophecy. The abolition of mediators, the stress
on the individual conscience, left God speaking direct to his
elect" 

"But for seventeenth-century English radicals the religion of the heart was the
answer to the pretensions of the academic divinity of ruling-class
universities. Emphasis on private interpretation was not however mere absolute
individualism. The congregation was the place in which interpretations were
tested and approved" 

"... no magistrates may forbid preaching of the gospel by gifted
laymen; that 'the variety of forms in the world is the beauty
of the world'. He told M.P.S to their faces that it was not
Parliament's job to reform the church: that was for members
of congregations, among whom 'a poor plain countryman, by
the spirit which he hath received, is better able to judge of
truth and error touching the things of God than the greatest
philosopher, scholar or doctor in the world that is destitute of
it'. In 1641 Sir Edward Dering 'started with wonder and
anger' when 'a bold mechanical' said 'I hope your worship is
too wise to believe that which you call your creed.' It took
some getting used to."    

"There is overwhelming contemporary evidence that the
strength of the sectaries lay with what Lilburne called 'the base
and obscure fellows of the world."    

"In 1646 a trooper in
Northamptonshire 'laid his hand on his sword and said 'This
sword should never be laid down, nor many thousands more,
whilst there was a priest left in England."' In the following
April troopers in Suffolk were saying they would never disband 'till we have cut all the priests' throats'. Three months
earlier, when a group of Presbyterian ministers visited the New
Model Army at Oxford, 'the multitude of soldiers in a violent
manner called upon us to prove our calling,... whether those
that are called ministers had any more authority to preach in
public than private Christians which were gifted'."

"'How many men are made poor by making a few ministers rich?'"    

"'We were before ruled by King, Lords and Commons, now by a General, a Court Martial and House of Commons; and we pray you what is the difference?'"   

"At the beginning (say they), when God hadfirstmade the world,
all men were alike, there was no principality, then was no bondage
or villeinage: that grew afterwards by violence and cruelty. Therefore why should we live in this miserable slavery under those proud
lords and crafty lawyers, etc.?"    

"Echoing Sir Thomas More, the author denounced
the rich thieves' who 'make a combination and call it a law,
to hang a poor man if he do steal, when they have wrongfully
taken from him all his maintenance'. They make themselves
thieves by Act of Parliament' The property of the rich should
be shared among the poor, and redivided at least once a year.
To give unto every man with discretion so near as may be an
equal share of earthly goods,'..." 

"They simply strengthened
the demagogic arguments of Oliver Cromwell, who lumped
Levellers and True Levellers together as 'a despicable and contemptible generation of men', 'persons differing little from
beasts'. 'Did not the levelling principle tend to reducing all
to an equality, ... to make the tenant as liberal a fortune as
the landlord? ... a pleasing voice to all poor men, and truly
not unwelcome to all bad men."   

"The millenarian clergyman Nathanael Homes
rejected 'a levelling anarchy'. William Hartley complained in
1651 that sectaries were branded as Tompson's party, Levellers'. The word Leveller is a term of abuse cast upon many a
person for holding forth of righteous principles.' Yet even he
felt he had to go out of his way to disavow communism."    

"One must insist, to restore the balance, that the constitutional Levellers
were a very radical left wing of the revolutionary party. Some
of those who loom larger in this book were much less intellectually consistent and principled than the Levellers: their rejection of capitalism was often backward-looking, negative and
unrealistic. The group of whom this is least true, I shall argue,
was the True Levellers. It is important to see them in this historical perspective."      

"Communal cultivation could
allow for capital investment in improvements without sacrificing the interests of commoners. There was land enough to maintain ten times the present population, abolish begging and
crime, and make England 'first of the nations."   

"The economic arguments against those who merely defended commoners' traditional rights in the
waste were overwhelming. England's growing population could
be fed only by more intensive cultivation, by bringing marginal
land under the plough. Enclosure by men with capital, brutally
disregarding the rights of commoners, did at least do the job;
in the long run, its advocates rightly claimed, it created more
employment. But in the short run it disrupted a way of life,
causing intense misery; and the employment which it did ultimately create was not of a sort to attract free commoners.
Collective cultivation of the waste by the poor could have
had the advantages of large-scale cultivation, planned development, use of fertilizers, etc. It could have fed the expanding
English population without disrupting the traditional way of
life to anything like the extent that in fact happened. The
Diggers sowed their land with carrots, parsnips and beans -
crops of the sort which were to transform English agriculture
in the seventeenth century by making it possible to keep cattle
alive throughout the winter in order to fertilize the land.
'Manuring' is the crucial word in Winstanley's programme.
(True religion and undefiled is to let every one quietly have
earth to manure.') Winstanley had got a solution to his own paradox: 'the bondage the poor complain of, that they are
kept poor by their brethren in a land where there is so much
plenty for everyone, if covetousness and pride did not rule as
king in one brother over another'."     

"Winstanley told lords of manors that
'the power of enclosing land and owning property was brought into
the creation by your ancestors by the sword; which first did murder their fellow creatures, men, and after plunder or steal away
their land, and left this land successively to you, their children.
And therefore, though you did not kill or thieve, yet you hold that cursed thing in your hand by the power of the sword; and so you
justify the wicked deeds of your fathers, and that sin of your fathers
shall be visited upon the head of you and your children to the third
and fourth generation, and longer too, till your bloody and thieving
power be rooted out of the land'."     

Echoes of Australia in the statement above.. 

"The philosophy which started which a vision seems to have had ended as a kind of materialist pantheism, in which God
or abstract Reason can be known only in man or nature; and
man is more important than abstractions.
Winstanley pushed this tendency to its logical conclusion.
With a nod both towards the magical tradition and towards
experimental science, he wrote:
'To know the secrets of nature is to know the works of God...
And indeed if you would know spiritual things, it is to know how
the spirit or power of wisdom and life, causing motion or growth,
dwells within and governs both the several bodies of the stars and
planets in the heavens above; and the several bodies of the earth
below, as grass, plants, fishes, beasts, birds and mankind. For to
reach God beyond the creation, or to know what he will be to a
man after the man is dead, if any otherwise than to scatter him
into his essences of fire, water, earth and air of which he is compounded, is a knowledge beyond the line or capacity of man to
attain to while he lives in his compounded body.'"

"'There is no man or
woman needs go to Rome nor to hell below ground, as some
talk, to find the Pope, Devil, Beast or power of darkness;
neither to go up into heaven above the skies to find Christ the
word of life. For both these powers are to be felt within a man,
fighting against each other.'"    

"Winstanley, by a remarkable imaginative feat, transmuted
this apocalyptic vision into a theory of rationalism and democracy. The key lies in his equation of God with Reason, and
Reason with the law of the universe. In the third age, now beginning, 'the Lord himself, who is the Eternal Gospel, doth
manifest himself to rule in the flesh of sons and daughters'.
Their hearts will be retuned to the Reason which pervades the
cosmos, to 'that spiritual power that guides all men's reasoning
in right order to a right end'. Every man subject to Reason's
law becomes a Son of God. He no longer 'looks upon a God
and a ruler without him, as the beast of the field does'; his
ruler is within, whether it be called conscience or love or
Reason. This is Christ's second coming, after which 'the ministration of Christ in one single person is to be silent and draw
back' before the righteousness and wisdom in every person."

"Men conscious of their
helplessness, their frustration, could easily be convinced that
they were sinful. Because they were sinful they were discouraged from trying to remedy their situation. If they confessed to a priest and paid the appropriate fees, they could be
absolved and set free from their sins - until the next time.
The medieval church had evolved a workable system of social
control, aided by the useful invention of Purgatory. But it
over-reached itself in the sale of indulgences, remission of the
penalties of sin for cash down."    

"Tawney was referring especially to Calvinism
when he spoke of 'the central paradox of religious ethics - that
only those are nerved with the courage needed to turn the
world upside down who are convinced that already, in a higher
sense, it is disposed for the best by a Power of which they
are the humble instruments'."  

"This double sense of power - individual self-confidence and
strength through unity - produced that remarkable liberation
of energy which is typical of Calvinism and the sects during
our period. Men felt free: free from hell, free from priests,
free from fear of worldly authorities, free from the blind forces
of nature, free from magic. The freedom might be illusory:
an inner psychological self-deception. Or it might correspond
to outer reality, in that it was likely to be felt by men who
were economically independent. But even an illusory freedom
might give a man the power to win real freedom, just as
mimetic magic did help primitive man to grow his crops."   

"English and Scottish Presbyterians anticipated Hobbes
in teaching that it was the function of civil government to
restrain the depravity natural to all men. Henry Parker, a
political associate of the Presbyterians and a theoretical predecessor of Hobbes, wrote in 1642 that 'man being depraved
by the Fall of Adam grew so untame and uncivil a creature that
the law of God written in his breast was not sufficient to
restrain him from mischief or to make him sociable'."    

"The idea that it is just to visit
the sins of the fathers upon all succeeding generations is part
of the primitive complex of ideas which produced the blood
feud, and is well suited to a society based on inherited status."   

"There were indeed inherent contradictions in combining a
theology which stressed that the elect were a minority with
a moral preaching designed to reach all men. All the orthodox
would have agreed with William Crashaw's dictum: The
greater part generally is the worst part.' Thomas Hooker in
1632 could 'speak it by experience that the meaner sort of
people, it is incredible what ignorance is among them'. Perkins and other Puritan theologians solved this by teaching that
God would accept the will for the deed; that although we
cannot save ourselves by our efforts, nevertheless a passionate
desire to be saved was strong presumptive evidence that one
was in fact among the elect."   

Difficult to perceive the true dimensions of ones life from which such beliefs were given reality and substantiation. We cannot just assume that all were uncritical, that one didn't toil and labor in their secretly felt contradictions. What wonder. 

"The elite were the elect."   

"Protestantism began by looking like a great liberation
of the human spirit. But within a decade of Luther's protest
he was faced by a peasant revolt which attacked property and
social subordination, as Luther understood them, altogether;
and within another decade the Anabaptists of Munster rose
against the whole existing social order. Printing had made
protestantism possible because it facilitated the rapid spread
of popular theology among the literate, especially in towns.
Where the Lollard Bible circulated in tens of copies, Tyndale's
New Testament circulated in hundreds and the Geneva Bible
in thousands. But printing also ruined protestantism as a single coherent creed because the reading of books is even less possible to control than the reading of manuscripts. The pocketable
Geneva Bible could be privately digested and privately interpreted. Once the masses of the population were called into
political activity, whether in sixteenth-century Germany or
seventeenth-century England, some were bound to demand
salvation for themselves. The German and Dutch Anabaptists
failed in their attempt to storm heaven."   

"If sin was an invention, what then justified private property,
the division of society into classes, the state which protected
property? Nobody could stop such questions being generally
discussed in the 1640s. Winstanley reversed the traditional formula: it was not the Fall that caused property, but property
that caused the Fall. 'When self-love began to arise in the
earth, then man began to fall.' 'When mankind began to
quarrel about the earth, and some would have all and shut
out others, forcing them to be servants; this was man's fall.'
State power, armies, laws and the machinery of 'justice', prisons,
the gallows, all exist to protect the property which the rich
have stolen from the poor. Exploitation, not labour, is the
curse. We must abolish wage labour if we are to restore prelapsarian freedom. Buying and selling, and the laws that regulate the market, are part of the Fall."    

"He shared the hope of alchemists and magical
writers, that the abundance of Eden might be recreated on
earth, in Bacon's case by experiment, mechanical skill, and intense cooperative effort."   

"Francis Osborne in 1656 reflected that
once implicit faith in the creed authoritatively established by a
state church was abandoned, 'the unbiassed rabble ... emancipated out of the fetters their former creed confined them to,'
would question the existence of heaven and hell no less than
the Divine Right of Kings of which the Puritan clergy had
taught them to be sceptical."      

"Until men had worked out a much stronger sense of history,
of evolution, atheism could only be a negative, epicurean creed
in a static universe. Atheists could hardly work for a transformation of society: for the revolutionaries God was the
principle of change. If they lost belief in God, what remained?
This is what made Milton insist on human freedom and responsibility, in his desperate attempt to assert eternal providence
and justify the ways of God to men. The backwardness of
history and natural science made it impossible to break through to a theory of evolution in which God would become an unnecessary hypothesis."
    
"We can recognize them as being in the modern world. But not wholly. However
radical the conclusions, however heretical their theology,
their escape-route from theology was theological - even Winstanley's."    

"But they also marked a refusal of
deference from the young to the old, from sons to fathers. No
one who has read Thomas Ellwood's vivid account of his
struggle with his father can doubt that die fiercest and most
anguished battles were those waged within the home, between
the generations. This aspect of the rise of Quakerism in gentry
families perhaps deserves further consideration."    

"When kingdoms came to be
Christian, then kingdoms began to be churches; yea, churches
came to be kingdoms, and national churches began. Then also Antichrist came to be great.'"    

"Winstanley agreed
that holy communion was not a sacrament but eating and
drinking in any house, 'in love and sweet communion with one
another'"    

"The analogy of modern drug-taking should enable us to
understand that - in addition to the element of communal
love-feast in such gatherings - the use of tobacco and alcohol
was intended to heighten spiritual vision. Some years later
the millenarian John Mason was excessively addicted to smoking, and 'generally while he smoked he was in a kind of
ecstasy'. (Tobacco was still a novel and rather naughty stimulant, though by 1640 it had risen to first place among London's imports.)    

"They 'sung and whistled and danced'. Bunyan thought
Ranters talked too much: this is indeed one contemporary
meaning of the verb 'to rant'. Bunyan's comment may have its
bearing on Quaker silence."    

"Swearing was an act of defiance, both of God and of middle-class
society, of the Puritan ethic. 'Many think to swear is gentleman-like,' as Bunyan put it. Courtiers and members of the upper
class could get away with swearing: royalists in the civil war
were known to their opponents as 'Dammees'. For the lower
classes swearing was expensive: we recall the 'debauched seaman' who after being fined at the rate of 6d. for an oath put
2s. 6d. on the table and had his money's worth. Lower-class
use of oaths was a proclamation of their equality with the
greatest, just as Puritan opposition to vain swearing was a
criticism of aristocratic and plebeian irreligion. But lower-class class and Ranter swearing was also a revolt against the imposition of Puritan middle-class standards, interfering with the
simple pleasures of the poor for ideological reasons. Bibliolatry
led to a phobia about swearing; rejection of the Bible made it
possible again, and with it a release of the repressions which
gave the Puritan middle class their moral energy."    

"John Holland, a hostile but not obviously unfair witness, says Ranters
call God Reason (as Gerrard Winstanley had done). One of
them said that if there was any God at all, he himself was one.
God is in everyone and every living thing, said Jacob Bauthumley: 'man and beast, fish and fowl, and every green thing,
from the highest cedar to the ivy on the wall'. 'He does not
exist outside the creatures.' God is in 'this dog, this tobacco
pipe, he is me and I am him'; he is in 'dog, cat, chair, stool'."   

"The existence of evil was a subject to which Ranters paid a
good deal of attention: simple believers found their arguments
difficult to answer. If God is omnipotent, some Ranters asked,
why does he permit evil? Others denied that there was any
such thing as sin; if there was, it must be part of God's plan. The day of judgment is either 'an invented thing', 'a bugbear
to keep men in awe', or it had begun already. There was no life
after death: 'even as a stream from the ocean was distinct in
itself while it was a stream, but when returned to the ocean was
therein swallowed and became one with the ocean: so the spirit
of man whilst in the body was distinct from God, but when
death came it returned to God, and so became one with God,
yea God itself.'"    

"Fortunately, 'the anti-christian law of compelling me to church' was no longer in force, since the act of 1650 abolished compulsory Sunday church attendance." - Imagine that, in LAW!   

"So we see radical religion passing into rationalism."   

"It may have been
this experience with Ranters which convinced Winstanley of
the need to have laws and rules in his ideal community, and
punishments to deal with the idle and the ignorant, the unruly
and the 'self-ended spirits."    

"Nayler had the right to say that, arrived at through his great
suffering and shame. ('I found it alone, being forsaken. I have. fellowship there with them who lived in dens and desolate
places in the earth') But those phrases, 'what is expedient',
what edifies', closed the door on much that had been courageous and life-giving in the early Quaker movement. Heresy
and schism were endemic among Quakers for the rest of the
century. The enormous problem of disciplining this amorphous
movement fell principally to George Fox. For all protestant
churches the appeal to conscience, to the inner voice, conflicted
with the necessity of organization and discipline if the church
was to survive. Luther's rejection of his own principles when
quoted against him was only the first of many examples."    

"After the revolutionary decades,
after Winstanley, Hobbes, Writer and Fisher, the Bible would
never be the same again. But to university divines, Fisher, like
William Dell, must have seemed to be committing treason to
the clerical caste, by using the apparatus of scholarship to expose the scholarly mysteries to public obloquy: the rabbis particularly disliked being alarmed by rustics. Fisher deserves
greater recognition as a precursor of the English enlightenment than he has yet received."    

"Chemistry became almost equated with radical theology.
Webster himself hailed Erbery as 'chemist of truth and gospel'.
Francis Osborne in 1656 said that the Socinians were 'looked
upon as the most chemical and rational part of our many divisions'. Samuel Fisher in 1662 praised 'that chemical divinity,
that God is declaring forth the mysteries of his kingdom by'."    

"Not only did England enter the epoch of the Industrial
Revolution with a ruling elite ignorant of science; the scientists
of the Royal Society themselves abandoned the radicals 'enthusiastic' schemes for equal educational opportunity. So the
reservoir of scientific talent in the lower classes which these
schemes had envisaged remained untapped, and 'England advanced towards the technological age with a population ill equipped to take the fullest advantage of its resources."   

"Mr Thomas quotes attacks made during the
Revolution, sometimes by women themselves, on their limited
educational opportunities, their confinement to domestic duties,
their subjection to their husbands and the injustices of a commercial marriage market."   

"Quakers - following the example of Familists and some Baptists - practised
marriage by declaration before the congregation, with no other
civil or religious ceremony."    

"What happened to the ideas which radicals for
a brief period publicized, and which then returned to obscurity,
we do not know. But Mr A. L. Morton has established that
Blake at least inherited ideas similar to those of the Ranters, as
well as knowing his Milton intimately."    

"I shall assume without argument that there is such a thing as
the protestant ethic: an emphasis on the religious duty of
working hard in one's calling, of avoiding the sins of idleness,
waste of time, over-indulgence in the pleasures of the flesh.
This ethic was most easily absorbed by the industrious middle
classes in town and country - yeomen, craftsmen, merchants,
some gentlemen. It gave a moral energy, a conviction of
righteousness, that enabled them to carry out heroic feats of
political revolution, and to endure that more humdrum day-to-day struggle to save and accumulate the capital which was indispensable to business success. It also convinced many of
them that it was a religious duty to impose regular, disciplined
labour on the lower classes (and occasionally, more daringly,
on the idle upper classes): at least to create social conditions
which discouraged idleness. This meant opposing observance
of saints' days, and the traditional village festivals and sports,
as well as sexual irresponsibility."     

"'Fanaticism' and 'enthusiasm' were the bugbears of polite
and scholarly restoration society. The carefully cultivated
classicism of the age of Dryden and Pope was (among other
things) the literary form of this social reaction. For the radicals
Latin and Greek had been the languages of Antichrist, as
they were the languages of the universities, law, medicine, the
three intellectual elites. Dr P. W. Thomas has shown us how
the classical principles of regularity and propriety had appealed to isolated royalist intellectuals during the decades of defeat.
They saw themselves as preservers of literary culture in a time
of barbarism."    

"The latter were savage because they had no
assurance that what they wanted to defend could be preserved
by any other means than savagery."
