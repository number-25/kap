A friend of mine once remarked that "We are not smart enough for our age
[epoch]". What could they have meant by this? Education levels across the
world are remarkably high, and many believe ourselves capable of good
decision making. Yet, many aspects of the world around us elude, deceive, and
confuse us. From time to time we find that it is exactly those who should know, who are
falling short of expectations. In these moments, that glossy shine of modernity, brittles away so slightly, and we feel fooled. 

No doubt, there is naturally opposition to this broad statement --- one would say
that, *No! we are in fact smart enough for our age, we have mastery over the
skies and the earth, our advancement in technology is not comparable to any
epoch before us*. It is true, surely, us, taken as a whole, are collectively
smart enough; and who could be surprised, as much of this world has been
established by us. Indeed, we do know how electricity works, we do know about
carbon dating, we can perform heart surgery. And yet, why do most doctors not
know how to weigh the benefits and dangers of simple medical screens? To
resolve this butting of heads, the *we* here refers to sum of individuals
navigating life as independent beings, as opposed to the totality of the human species and all of its
information.  We can simultaneously know how to build atomic weaponry, whilst
having the majority of our world be statistically iliterate. The two are mostly
unrelated. On one hand the repository of all human knowledge, the other, the
understanding embodied in a single person. 

Maybe, "we as people, are not smart enough for this age". The social
scientist Gerd Gigerenze might say, "We as people, are not *risk literate*
enough for this age". The way I take it then, is that my friend was discussing
us as people encountering world, living our lives in modern society, with all
it's technological features. Gerd, in his book *Risk Savvy*, opens by touching
on something similar;

> Literacy---the ability to read and write---is the lifeblood of an informed citizenship in a democracy. But knowing how to read and write isn't enough. *Risk literacy* is the basic knowledge required to deal with a modern technology society. The breakneck speeed of technological innovation will make risk literacy as indespensable in the twenty-first century as reading and writing were in previous centuries. Without it, you jeopardize your health and money, or may be manipulated into unrealistic fears and hopes. One might think that the basics of risk literacy are already being taught. Yet you will look in vain for it in most high schools, law schools, medical school, and beyond. As a result, most of us are risk illiterate.

I feel this is what we're getting at here. Not to pile upon our inadequecies---but put in another way----
we are not adjusted, adapted enough to our age. We are still playing catchup, running, trying to keep
up with the pace of it all, the speed and volume of information, and the
seeming legitimacy that it holds. Our tools, techniques and methods to navigate
and interpret aspects of our time, are simply not developed sufficiently. 

As moderns, I don't think it misguided to say that we excel in putting forth
predictions, and specifically, quantifying those predictions. Through our
technologies of measurement, and our analytical methods, presenting
probabilities of events are a regular, if not, default characteristic of our
communication. Perhaps we could go so far as say they are an expectation at
this stage. At our doctors offices we seek likelihoods of *x*, we hear
weatherwomen telling us of rains and droughts, financial analysts the trends in
exchange rates for next year. We are accustomed to think numerically and so the
allegations of illiteracy do strike us unjustified. Despite this numeracy, how often do we
take the next step---putting confidence values on those
predictions themselves---and---placing them under scrutiny. They are taken for
granted, as concrete as heat from fire. Not all numbers are created equally, unfortunately. 

Looking at some examples, Gerd describes an interactive lecture that
he presented to a room of gynecologists at a medical networking event. In
Australia, the time it takes to recieve a gynecology qualification is 10
years at minimum, with 12-14 years being more common. These are
highly qualified individuals, perhaps the most in our societies. He presented the room with a question; *"If a
women undergoes a routine mammography screening, and tests positive, what is
the likelihood that she actually has breast cancer?"*. He proceeded to provide
the rates of breast cancer among women, and the test efficacy statistics; rates of true to false
positives and negatives. Collecting the doctors answers via an interactive
polling system, he found that only 21 percent of the doctors would correctly
inform women of their likelihood of having breast cancer given a positive
screening. One has to woinder what could be going wrong here. Much of Gerd's
work is dedicated to understanding why these experts are not as literate as
they should be, and fortunately, many of his answers provide redemption. These
same test efficacy statistics, when transformed into natural frequencies, often
allow people to solve these same problems which were once too complicated when
presented in a classical probabilistic form[^1][^2][^3]. This could be as simple as
transforming a percentage to an easily parsed ratio e.g. 1% to 1 in 100, and
working in numbers which are more *natural* to us.  

Even then, leaving it in doctors hands doesn't sit well. Our technological
sophistication has led to high degrees of domain specific knowledge which are
acquired through these years of education. It does feel as though everybody is
represented as an expert at something. Some of these disciplines are defined to
a degree by their mandate to make these forecasts. A sort of monopoly of
legitimate prediction, ala, the state and it's violence. They are provided such
social mandates because they are experts. As such, it is entirely normal to put
our trust in them, and a trust that is held in high regard is a pillar for
social cohesian. There is a really sinister side of this illiteracy---there are
real people who bear the consequences of misdiagnosis---bodies are mutilated,
made incontant, subjected to hopeless chemotherapeutic treatments with
troubling side effects, tremendous resources wasted along the way. These are
all features of a technological age which should know better, which will know
better. Gerd's insistence is that we should no longer view this as even more
domain knowledge that we need, but general, broad sweeping risk and statistical
literacy from the base up. I was shocked to read that sixth graders' performance with natural frequencies matched the performance of adults with probabilities graders[^4].  

These shortcomings become even more urgent, and are compounded by the
intentional misrepresentation of information; naked deception. Across numerous
fields, not just health and medicine, there are bodies who purposefully
misconstrue for their own gain. A conscious propogation of misunderstanding,
most often for monetary benefit and gain. Opening up a webpage, our University is boasting of a research group that has found a 20% increase in survival, which, standing on it's own, seems remarkable. That is until
the absolute increase is revealed. Survival has increased from 1 in 10'000 to 1.2 in 10'000. Would you
get on a treatment for a disease which increased your survival chances from 1 to
1.2 in 10'000? To hammer a previous point, let us not forget the dark flip side of
these interventions, the side effects. Thinking both ways is a feature of risk literacy. 

we are steeped in information represented in statistical and numerical form, it comes quick and swift, all the time, it's used in many ways in society as communication and propoganda  --- that is a KEY aspect
How often do those who are triggered by online rage bait, reflect on whether they are being hoodwinked - trapped in a algorithmically generated pocket of reality fo- this is the same reason why doctors

Misrepresnting extremely unlikely events as though they are far more numerous than they are - correlating this increase with the trend that 'society is collapsing' e.g. 

Eugenics was predicated on a fallicious application of measurement 

Enquire about the "reference class" - this just asking "

The point is that with long enough - we can spot these warnings, the way we can sense heat from a fire, but ours is now an environment which puts new demands on us. 


## Examples of not knowing -> discuss why we believe experts to a degree -> why we need this literacy as this is the state of play at the moment -> then talk about those who say we are smart enough and this is what we need to do -> then why this isn't the answer also -> heuristics which perform better 

*No doubt this has implications for democracy, how important it is to wrestle the power from those who believe us best managed by small groups of elites - the information from a group can approach the correct answer better (Galton pig weighing) - the elitist Galton. - the topic of another post*

Get to the point where we can just run from the threat, it becomes part of what Gerd called our adaptive toolbox, ingrained for so long that its second nature - akin to what we expect of reading and writing today. 
Adaptive toolkit, which, is used unconsiously 

Having street smarts is knowing that others are using symbols to decieve you --- something which should be made laughable.. 

1) know your environment better - understand what it is now made up of and how

Use example of stroke test? --- why the hell are we using MRI scans? Due to lack of trust in society, they may decisions defensively, 


Another dimension of statistical literacy is having the capacity to determine whether a newer technology is better than another technique --- it's the second bullwark against - the idea that newer is better, more is better.  Which comes with todays world - the bombardment of the *new, the better, the optimal* 


Are a general features - the organisation of information matters, not just its quantity and frequency, less is often more. 

Another says, we are smart enough, we have the tools, and this is how you solve  --- at least this one 


From biological systems, we know that complexity doesn't constitute efficacy - a biological function made up of only three biochemical pathways is likely more advantageous to an organism than is the same function created by 10 pathways. So simply adding components to brute force your way to an outcome is not necessarily. Gerd highlights wonderfully, how simply representing the same information in a different way allows people to - the problem gets solved, - in this case, showing statistical information in the form of *natural frequencies*, as opposed to giving them a completely written out conditional statement 

Simple 1/N investement strategies outperform complex approaches --- 

On the other hand, stands that cynical idea that we are in fact apeish fools, that need to be nudged and herded towards the --- we are fallicious and are regularly fooled, so it's best that we relegate to groups of experts, technocrats. Well, the jig is up, it is often the technocrats who do not even know. We must then defer to the originators of this

Fast, frugal, relying on minimal information, yet, when compared to methods seeking optimality, actually outperform them. Much of this could be avoided by resigning ourselves from the compulsion to feel we are always correct; that strive towards 

One of the themes running through Gerd's work, is that it is futile to believe - we both know less than we believe we do, yet also more than we give ourselves credit for! 


Not make the decision with the belief that there is no uncertainty, but, make it in the face of uncertainty, atleast knowing where one stands! A far more honest place to put ones feet. No sailor was ever surprised to find the ocean was full of water - they put themselves there, and, you'd hope, knew that from time to time, big waves were brewing. 

Problems of excess information, whos answer is not in the pursuit of even more information... 

We are mistaken, .. optimisation - optimality ...

a set of pithy examples, what to order at a restaurant you havent'ed visited before? Create a 

we also have the often mentioned 'street smarts', a , meaning, an intricate understanding of our social fabric, and the psychology of other human beings 

Gerd would say, we are NOT smart enough, but we can be savvy enough!
