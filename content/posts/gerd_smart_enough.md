A friend of mine once remarked that "We are not smart enough for our age
(epoch)". What could they have meant by this? Education levels across the
world are remarkably high, and many believe ourselves capable of good
decision making. Yet, many aspects of the world around us elude, deceive, and
confuse us. From time to time we find that it is exactly those who should know, who are
falling short of expectations. In these moments, that glossy shine of modernity, brittles away so slightly, and we feel fooled. 

No doubt, there is naturally opposition to this broad statement --- one would say
that, No! we are in fact smart enough for our age, we have mastery over the
skies and the earth, our advancement in technology is not comparable to any
epoch before us. It is true, surely, us, taken as a whole, are collectively
smart enough; and who could be surprised, as much of this world has been
established by us. Indeed, we do know how electricity works, we do know about
carbon dating, we can perform heart surgery. And yet, why do most doctors not
know how to weigh the benefits and dangers of simple medical screens? To
resolve this butting of heads, the *we* here refers to sum of individuals
navigating life, as opposed to the totality of the human species and all of its
information.  We can simultaneously know how to build atomic weaponry, whilst
having the majority of our world be statistically iliterate. The two are mostly
unrelated. On one hand the repository of all human knowledge, the other, the
understanding embodied in a single person. 

Maybe, "we as people, are not smart enough for this age". The social
scientist Gerd Gigerenze might say, "We as people, are not *risk literate*
enough for this age". The way I take it then, is that my friend was discussing
us as people encountering world, living our lives in modern society, with all
it's technological features. Gerd, in his book *Risk Savvy*, opens by touching
on something similar;

> Literacy---the ability to read and write---is the lifeblood of an informed citizenship in a democracy. But knowing how to read and write isn't enough. *Risk literacy* is the basic knowledge required to deal with a modern technology society. The breakneck speeed of technological innovation will make risk literacy as indespensable in the twenty-first century as reading and writing were in previous centuries. Without it, you jeopardize your health and money, or may be manipulated into unrealistic fears and hopes. One might think that the basics of risk literacy are already being taught. Yet you will look in vain for it in most high schools, law schools, medical school, and beyond. As a result, most of us are risk illiterate.

I feel this is what we're getting at here. Not to pile upon our inadequecies--- but put in another way----
we are not adjusted, adapted enough to our age. We are still playing catchup, running, trying to keep
up with the pace of it all, the speed and volume of information, and the
seeming legitimacy that it holds. Our tools, techniques and methods to navigate
and interpret aspects of our time, are simply not developed sufficiently. 

As moderns, I don't think it misguided to say that we excel in putting forth predictions, and specifically, quantifying those predictions. Through our technologies of measurement, and our analytical methods, 

One of the salient features of our age is the volume

mastery, over financial markets, over health, science, --- yet, this mastery, if often 


Having street smarts is knowing that others are using symbols to decieve you --- something which should be made laughable.. 

Use example of stroke test? --- why the hell are we using MRI scans? Due to lack of trust in society, they may decisions defensively,

Risk - uncertainty 

Adaptive toolkit, which, is used unconsiously 

Are a general features - the organisation of information matters, not just its quantity and frequency, less is often more. 

We have put trust in those - deferrence to experts 

20% increase in survival, standing on it's own, seems remarkable. That is until the absolute increase is revealed, from 1 in 10'000 to 1.2 in 10'000. Would you get on a treatement for cancer which increased your survival chances from 1 to 1.2 in 10'000? Let us not forget the dark side of these interventions, the side effects. 

Strangely, it is often preciesly this deferal to the sum total of human knowledge which excuses us from our own shortcomings. A deferral to expertise. 

An inversion, "All I know is that I know nothing" to, "All I know is that we all know, and therefore I know something"  "We all know that we all know, so"

Another says, we are smart enough, we have the tools, and this is how you solve  --- at least this one 

How often do those who are triggered by online rage bait, reflect on whether they are - this is the same reason why doctors

From biological systems, we know that complexity doesn't constitute efficacy - a biological function made up of only three biochemical pathways is likely more advantageous to an organism than is the same function created by 10 pathways. So simply adding components to brute force your way to an outcome is not necessarily. Gerd highlights wonderfully, how simply representing the same information in a different way allows people to - the problem gets solved, - in this case, showing statistical information in the form of *natural frequencies*, as opposed to giving them a completely written out conditional statement 

Simple 1/N investement strategies outperform complex approaches --- 

In all of this, the stress is on known your domain! 

On the other hand, stands that cynical idea that we are in fact apeish fools, that need to be nudged and herded towards the --- we are fallicious and are regularly fooled, so it's best that we relegate to groups of experts, technocrats. Well, the jig is up, it is often the technocrats who do not even know. We must then defer to the originators of this

Fast, frugal, relying on minimal information, yet, when compared to methods seeking optimality, actually outperform them. Much of this could be avoided by resigning ourselves from the compulsion to feel we are always correct; that strive towards 

It would be difficult to mistake survival for - it is given, no doubt, that we are not blundering idiots walking off of cliffs regularly, - yet the bar is unfair, what sentient being 

Entire industries have been erected --- to illustrate, can we imagine a 

One of the themes running through Gerd's work, is that it is futile to believe - we both know less than we believe we do, yet also more than we give ourselves credit for! 

These are compounded by the intentional misrepresentation of information --- naked deception.  

Examples are in fact, purported experts in their domains...

Not make the decision with the belief that there is no uncertainty, but, make it in the face of uncertainty, atleast knowing where one stands! A far more honest place to put ones feet. No sailor was ever surprised to find the ocean was full of water - they put themselves there, and, you'd hope, knew that from time to time, big waves were brewing. 

Problems of excess information, whos answer is not in the pursuit of even more information... 

Volume, information 

The structure of the domain is such that 

We are mistaken, .. optimisation - optimality ...

we also have the often mentioned 'street smarts', a , meaning, an intricate understanding of our social fabric, and the psychology of other human beings 

Gerd would say, we are NOT smart enough, but we can be savvy enough!
