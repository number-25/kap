Breeding Superman: Nietzsche, Race and Eugenics in Edwardian and Interwar Britian, by Dan Stone 

### Introduction

"My contention is that in Britain the ideas existed without the movement, even
before the rise of fascism in Italy and Nazism in Germany.  Historians are
correct to note that fascism was squeezed out of the political process in the
interwar period. But I also argue that this outcome was by no means as
inevitable as the Whiggish historiography suggests, especially in the context
of the radical right before 1914. The manifold, radical ideas that feed fascism--- whether or not they subsequently guide it in power is not here the question---existed in abundance in Britain, especially in the Edwardian cultural sphere,
as I demonstrate below. British fascism failed not because it was an imitative
movement, but because mainstream conservatism did not need to co-opt its ideas
in order to remain in power."

"Intellectuals, it seems, were especially prone to fascism’s seductions.  This
is not therefore a book about fascism per se, but about streams or tendencies
in the history of ideas that, when combined, could have helped produce a fully
fledged native fascism... I will instead talk of the ‘extremes of Englishness’
for, as well as suggesting radicalism, this term indicates the existence of an
indigenous tradition of modern illiberalism."    

"...they all rested on an analysis of society which saw it as somehow in decline, and hence in need of rescue."

### Oscar Levy

"On the one hand, then, Levy shies away from arguments that proceed
from the belief that modern Europe can only be rescued from degeneration by
the creation of racial homogeneity through eugenic measures, arguing instead
for a kind of pre-nationalist aristocratic vision of a pan-European ruling
caste; on the other hand he accepts Nietzsche’s claim, primarily expounded
in the Genealogy of Morals, that the people who have led Europe to the moral
abyss which has sought equality at the expense of health, vigour and achievement are the Jews."   

"This remarkable piece of writing is easy to dismiss simply as Jewish self hatred. Yet although Levy was certainly so deeply immersed in the current
beliefs about Jews and Judaism that he accepted too readily many of the prevailing stereotypes, there was nevertheless a good reason for his approach. His
Nietzschean critique of civilisation took as its starting point an attack on a value
system supposedly introduced by the Jews, and continued by Christianity in
both its religious and post-religious (modern, revolutionary) manifestations.
Beginning with a sweeping claim that chimes in exactly with what Pitt-
Rivers had already said to him over lunch, Levy wrote:

> **There is scarcely an event in modern Europe that cannot be traced back to
the Jews... all latter-day ideas and movements have originally sprung from
a Jewish source, for the simple reason, that the Semitic idea has finally conquered and entirely subdued this only apparently irreligious universe of ours.
It has conquered it through Christianity, which of course, as Disraeli
pointed out long ago, is nothing but ‘Judaism for the people’.**

He then goes on, summarising Pitt-Rivers’s argument, to assert that this
history-of-ideas approach means that the author of the pamphlet can in no way
be regarded as a vulgar antisemite. Since Levy believes that a certain type of
antisemitism ‘does the Jews more justice than any blind philo-semitism... that
merely sentimental “Let-them-all-come-Liberalism”, which is nothing but the
Semitic Ideology over again’, he has no qualms about naming
himself an antisemite: ‘If you are an anti-Semite, I, the Semite, am an anti-
Semite too, and a much more fervent one than even you are... We have erred,
my friend, we have most grievously erred’.

In what, then, have the Jews erred? Levy accepts all of Pitt-Rivers’s allegations: the Jews, whether consciously or not, have been the principal agents of
economic and political misery in the world, through their dealings in international finance and their actions in promoting democracy and revolution;
Bolshevism, as the bearer of an originally Jewish ideal of equality for the
masses, was successful because it was opposed only by democracy, itself a
product of the same forces. This argument, however, leads Levy into the
realms of conspiracy theory, where he sounds more like Nesta Webster--- the
modern English originator of such theories--- or Lady Birdwood--- her latter-
day successor--– than Nietzsche. Seeing nothing but the play of ideas in
history, he asserts that ‘There is a direct line from Savonarola to Luther, and
from Luther to Robespierre, and from Robespierre to Lenin’. Thus
Bolshevism ‘is a religion and a faith’." 
  
"He never gave up, however, his search for a suitable refutation to communism."

In the above quotations, we see the lines of thought, far more common than one
often acknowledges, which converge around the refutation of the commmunist
movement; racial theory, social darwinism, anti-democratic politics, and the
apologia of imperialism.

### Anthony Mario Ludovici: A 'Light-Weight Superman'
"While it would be overstating the case to claim that Ludovici’s writings were
widely influential, he was well known as a public figure, whose ideas, particularly early on in his career, acquired some intellectual currency. But the
Whiggish view of history which still dominates interpretations of British fascism--- that its failure was a result of the inherent strength of British parliamentary
institutions – means that he has long been ignored. Ludovici’s idiosyncratic
blend of Förster-Nietzscheanism, Lamarckianism, social Darwinism, anti-
semitism, anti-feminism, monarchism and aristocratic conservatism was,
however, not as ridiculous to Edwardian minds as it is to ours today; it is easy
to dismiss Ludovici as a crank, and therefore miss the fact that many of his ideas
chimed in with those being espoused by people on the left as well as on the right
certainly before 1914, and even until 1939. I argue that reminding ourselves of
the existence of men such as Ludovici – who was not as marginal as might at
first appear – can help in dispelling the complacency which still surrounds the
historiography of British fascism."   

"The most concentrated outpouring of Ludovici’s works occurred, however,
during the 1920s and 1930s, when he was a member of the English Mistery.
Here he found the perfect forum for expounding his theories of degeneration,
birth control and race-breeding. The group is usually characterised as part of
the ‘muck and mysticism’ side of the British right, which indeed it was, with
its stress on rural values, the link between blood and soil, and service to the
monarch."   

"Behind all these topics, on which he wrote widely, lay a theory of degeneration."   

"The political implications of the belief in the dangers of cross-breeding were
clear to Ludovici: all forms of progressive thought were the cries of the weak
hoping to assert themselves in the face of the degeneration of the strong."   

"**Since the mid-nineteenth century, zoologists and anthropologists had justified the
mass-murder of ‘native’ people by theories of progress and degeneration.
Hitler was to apply the same logic when the principles of colonial rule were
applied to the European continent. For the argument that fascism partly represents a type of ‘colonialism come home’, Ludovici’s pamphlet is important
evidence, for here we find an explicit recommendation that genocide (dressed
up, as it always was, as scientific necessity) could be applied to the populations
of the metropole. Perhaps one of the reasons for the successes of German
and Italian fascism as opposed to British or French is connected to the failed
colonial policies of the former countries.**" --- an extremely pertinent line of thought. 

"The large number of strands that went into making up this ideology, from
Lamarckianism, eugenicism and antisemitism, to anti-feminism, aristocratic
revivalism, monarchism and ruralism, suggest the difficulty in pinning down
the boundaries between the radical right and the mainstream in the Edwardian
period. There is little to choose from between a Ludovici and a Willoughby de
Broke on essential points."

### Nietzsche and Eugenics
"In Britain these concerns were largely responses to new social and
political developments: increasing urbanisation, working-class organisation,
feminism, the loss of world economic superiority and the desire to maintain
the empire; in general, the threat to old governing elites. To a certain constituency, Nietzsche seemed to offer both an explanation for the emergence of this
threat, and a remedy. Eugenics, grounded as it was in scientific research,
appeared to confirm empirically what Nietzsche had grasped philosophically."   

"We have become accustomed to associating such statements with the history
of Nazism. But Nazism was a part of a longer history of ideas, a history which
embraced a great variety of thinkers from the beginning of the nineteenth
century. This is not to say that people such as Lichtenberger can be considered to be Nazis; rather, it means that Nazism did not come from nowhere,
that the potential for violence exists across Europe – not just in Germany--– and
that dreams of purification, cleansing, health and the aesthetic modelling of
human beings are common and old ones."

Ideas which are part of the fabric of European intellectual history.
