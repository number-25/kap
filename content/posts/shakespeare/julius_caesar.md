A few beautiful lines from *Julius Caesar* 

*Cassius; lean and hungry...*

**CASSIUS**\
I know that virtue to be in your, Brutus,\
As well as I do know your outward favor.\
Well, honor is the subject of my story.\
I cannot tell what you and other men\
Think of this life; but for my single self,\
I had as lief not be, as live to be\
In awe of such a thing as I myself.\
I was born free as Caesar, so were you.\
We both have fed as well, and we can both\
Endure the winter's cold as well as he.\
For once upon a raw and gusty day,\
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shoes,\
Said Caesar to me "Dar'st thou, Cassius, now\
Leap in with me into this angry flood,\
And swim to yonder point?" Upon the word,\
Accoutred as I was I plunged in,\
And bade him follow. So indeed he did.\
The torrent roared, and we did buffet it\
With lusty sinews, throwing it aside,\
And stemming it with hearts of controversy.\
But ere we could arrive the point proposed,\
Caesar cried "Help me, Cassius, or I sink?"\
Ay, as Aeneas our great ancestor\
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder.\
The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber\
Did I the tired Caesar. And this man\
Is now become a god, and Cassius is\
A wretched creature, and must bend his body\
If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.\
He has a fever when he was in Spain,\
And when the fit was on him, I did mark\
How he did shake. 'Tis true, this god did shake.\
His coward lips did from their color fly;\
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world\
Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan,\
Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans\
Mark him and write his speeches in their books,\
"Alas!" it cried, "Give me some drink, Titinius,"\
As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me\
A man of such a feeble temper should\
So get the start of the majestic world,\
And bear the palm alone!\
    *Flourish and shout within*.\
