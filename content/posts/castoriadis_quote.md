*It is possible that at times people drape themselves in Roman tunics to play
the bourgeois revolution---or that a general wnats to play Joan of Arc in
twentieth-century dress; but how is it that, in real history, it is never
Zerlina who replies to Agamemnon and that Brutus never has Monsieur Perrichon
for his friend and confidant?* - Cornelius Castoriadis
