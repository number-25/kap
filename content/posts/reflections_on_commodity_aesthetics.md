In the beginning there was use-value... no doubt. 

In capitalism, the use-value of items, objects and all manner of articles of life are abstracted to their exchange-form on the market, given/since they are dominated by capital owners, for the end of profit. This foundational feature of capitalism, whereby distribution of articles for life are conquered and entrusted to profit-seeking firms, produces the impetus to amplify the *perceived* use-value of an item, thus ballooning it's potential exchange value towards the fulfillment of profit. 

Wolfgang's work is a remarkable exploration of the transformations of use-value and exchange-value, the illusions and mystification's which occur - their sexual guises and seductions, and their modifications of social behavior and anthropological. - human communities  


Through an long history of mediums, this image of use-value has been 
Engineered obsolescence, the production of low-quality items, the domination of advertising spheres, whereby the power to advertise is a direct extension from the extraction of profit - cyclicality, 

Capital has the power to change us far more than we change it. changes us far more than - - those seeking profit no doubt understand the techniques they are using, the means to their end, they are completely complicit in these maneouvers. What they aren't concious of, however, are the deformations of use-value which are taking place anthropologically - culture building, craftsmen of the future ensaring anybody who wishes in their blind philosophy.
