The books are filled with names of kings.&lt;br>
Was it the kings who hauled the craggy blocks of stone?&lt;br>
And Babylon, so many times destroyed.&lt;br>
Who built the city up each time? In which of Lima&amp;rsquo;s houses,&lt;br>
That city glittering with gold, lived those who built it?&lt;br>
In the evening when the Chinese wall was finished&lt;br>
Where did the masons go? Imperial Rome&lt;br>
Is full of arcs of triumph. Who reared them up? Over whom&lt;br>
Did the Caesars triumph? Byzantium lives in song.&lt;br>
Were all her dwellings palaces? And even in Atlantis of the legend&lt;br>
The night the seas rushed in,&lt;br>
The drowning men still bellowed for their slaves.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
