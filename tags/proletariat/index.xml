The books are filled with names of kings.&lt;br&gt;
Was it the kings who hauled the craggy blocks of stone?&lt;br&gt;
And Babylon, so many times destroyed.&lt;br&gt;
Who built the city up each time? In which of Lima&amp;rsquo;s houses,&lt;br&gt;
That city glittering with gold, lived those who built it?&lt;br&gt;
In the evening when the Chinese wall was finished&lt;br&gt;
Where did the masons go? Imperial Rome&lt;br&gt;
Is full of arcs of triumph. Who reared them up? Over whom&lt;br&gt;
Did the Caesars triumph? Byzantium lives in song.&lt;br&gt;
Were all her dwellings palaces? And even in Atlantis of the legend&lt;br&gt;
The night the seas rushed in,&lt;br&gt;
The drowning men still bellowed for their slaves.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
